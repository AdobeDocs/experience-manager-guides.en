- **H5P:** Adds interactive H5P package to your learning content. To add H5P content, place your cursor at the desired location and select **H5P** from the Insert menu. In the Insert H5P dialog, provide a reference to the H5P file you want to add to the learning content.

    If you prefer to use the H5P content from your system, then first [upload the file in DAM](../user-guide/authoring-upload-existing-files.md) using the **Upload assets** option, and then have it part of Repository view/Assets.

    Once done, review the H5P content in the Preview mode and published output. 

    >[!NOTE]
    >
    > Editing or creating H5P content is not supported within Adobe Experience Manager Guides. Prepare your H5P package externally before uploading.

    
- **MathML equation:** Inserts MathML equations to your content. You can create a MathML equation and select **Insert** to add it to your document.

    The equation is inserted with light gray background. At any time you can update an equation by right-clicking on an existing equation and selecting **Edit Math equation** from the context menu. For details on validating MathML equations in Experience Manager Guides, view [Validation of equations in the MathML editor](../user-guide/web-editor-other-features.md#validation-of-equations-in-the-mathml-editor).

- **Knowledge check:** Allows you to add questions in available formats (Single Correct, Multiple Correct, True/False, Match the Following, or insert from the question bank) to your topic for review and to confirm understanding without grading. These questions mirror standard formats and exclude scoring, making them ideal for self-assessment and suitable as part of course content or a topic before a quiz or assessment later, if available.

    You can configure correct answers and other required fields through the **Content properties** panel. For more details, view [Question types](./quiz-insert-questions.md). You can add various question types using the knowledge check options as shown below.
