# Supported presets

When publishing a course, you can choose SCORM and PDF to deliver your content in the most suitable format for your learners. You can use the following presets to publish your course: 

- **SCORM output:** The SCORM output preset allows you to publish course content that is fully compatible with Learning Management Systems (LMS). The currently supported standard for the SCORM output is SCORM 2004 - 4th edition.  

- **PDF:** The PDF output preset allows you to publish course content in a professional, print-ready format. The PDF format makes it ideal for sharing content for review or archival purposes.

Before we dive into the step-by-step process, here's a quick video overview to help you visualize how to create, configure and generate a SCORM and PDF output.
