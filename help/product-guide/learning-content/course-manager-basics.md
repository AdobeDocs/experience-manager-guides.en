# Understand the basics of the Course manager  

The **Course manager** is your central workspace for creating and managing courses. When you create a new course, it automatically opens in the Course manager panel from where you can start building your course.  

When working with Course manager, consider the following:  

- The course opens in read-only mode, and Version 1.0 is automatically assigned, indicating the initial version of the course. 
- To be able to edit a course, you need to get a lock from the **Options** menu. Once the course is locked, you can start adding topics or editing existing ones present in the course.

- The **Map console** icon in the panel takes you to the Map console, where the output presets configured by your Administrator are displayed. You can also access **Map console** from the **Options** menu.
