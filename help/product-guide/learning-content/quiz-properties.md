# Quiz properties 

You can configure the quiz properties using the following options: 

- Place your cursor on the quiz title or quiz intro and then open the **Content properties** panel from right panel. You can edit the quiz properties from here.

- Ensure the quiz title and introduction are not left blank when authoring the quiz, as they appear on the first slide of the published quiz. If removed by mistake, you can restore them using the **Add quiz title** and **Add quiz intro** toggle buttons.  
- You can enable grading for your quiz by turning on the **Graded quiz** toggle. Once enabled, you can choose the grading method, either percentage-based or absolute, and define the passing criteria accordingly.
