# Use interactive widgets

You can enhance the learning content by adding multiple widgets to make the course more interactive. Select the **Insert** menu on the toolbar to access the widgets. The available widgets include:

- **Accordion:** Adds an accordion to the content. You can insert suitable text in both the accordion header and its body. Its properties can be managed using the **Content properties**  panel, including options to allow single or multiple accordions to open simultaneously, as well as to add or remove elements.
