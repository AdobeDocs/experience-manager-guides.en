# Create Question bank   

You can ease the process of creating quizzes by inserting questions directly from a question bank. This feature allows you to reuse existing questions, maintain consistency across assessments, and save time during quiz creation.
To streamline quiz creation and reuse, you can create a customized question bank tailored to your specific requirements.

Before we dive into the step-by-step process, here's a short walkthrough video that demonstrates how to create a Question bank and use it within a Quiz.
