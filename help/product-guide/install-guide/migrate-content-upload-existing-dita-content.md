# Upload existing DITA content {#id176FF000JUI}

Most likely you would have a repository of existing DITA content that you would like to use with AEM Guides. For such existing content, you can use any of the following approaches to bulk upload your content into the AEM repository.

## Use a WebDAV tool 

If you are authoring your topics and maps in any other DITA editor, you can use any WebDAV tool to upload your files. The procedure given in this section uses WinSCP as the WebDAV tool to upload content.

Perform the following steps to use WinSCP to upload files:

1.  Download and install WinSCP on your computer.

1.  Launch the WinSCP app.

    The Login dialog appears.

1.  On the Login dialog, specify a New Site setting by choosing WebDAV as the **File Protocol** and providing other connection details such as:

    - the URL where your AEM server is hosted,

    - the port number \(default is 4502\), and

    - the user name and password to access your AEM server.

1.  Click **Login**.

    On a successful connection, you will see the contents of AEM Assets in the WinSCP user interface. You can easily browse, create, update, or delete content using the WinSCP file explorer.


## Use FrameMaker 

Adobe FrameMaker comes with a powerful AEM connector that allows you to easily upload your existing DITA and other FrameMaker documents \(.book and .fm\) into AEM. You can use various file upload functionalities such as uploading a single file, uploading a complete folder with or without dependencies \(like content references, cross-references, and graphics\).

Perform the following steps to use FrameMaker's AEM Connector to upload content:

1.  Launch FrameMaker.

1.  Open the **Connection Manager** dialog.

1.  Enter the following details to connect to the AEM repository:

    -   **Name**: Enter a descriptive name to identify the connection to your AEM server.
    -   **Server**: Enter the URL and port number of your AEM server.

    -   **User Name**/**Password**: Enter the user name and password to access the AEM server.

1.  Click **Connect**.

    Once the connection is successfully established, Assets from the AEM repository are displayed in the Repository Manager window.

    Right-clicking on any file or folder allows you to perform related operations. For example, if you right-click on a folder, you get options to upload a file, upload file with dependencies, upload an entire folder and so on.


## Configure UUID filename pattern 

When you import content, it is not necessary that your file names will be based on the UUID. In a system that uses UUID-based file names, it is mandatory that all files are referred using their UUIDs rather than their original file names. If an imported file doesn't have UUID-based file names, you can configure the system to add a UUID to their file property. This UUID is then used to refer such files where UUID is not used for naming the files.

Perform the following steps to check file names against a UUID pattern and assign UUID to files that do not have a UUID assigned:

1.  Open the Adobe Experience Manager Web Console Configuration page.

    The default URL to access the configuration page is:

    ```http
    http://<server name>:<port>/system/console/configMgr
    ```

1.  Search for and click on the *com.adobe.fmdita.config.ConfigManager* bundle.

1.  In the **UUID Filename Patterns** property, specify a pattern to check the imported file's names.

    If a file doesn't follow the specified pattern, a UUID is added to the file's property and all references to the file are updated with the UUID assigned to the file.

1.  Click **Save**.


## Upload content with UUID using a WebDav tool {#id201MI0I04Y4}

You can use any of the following methods to upload your content with UUID:

-   Drag-and-drop content from your local system.
-   Use the **Create** \> **Files** workflow from AEM's Assets UI.
-   Use a tool like WinSCP.

In case you use a tool like WinSCP, you can define the action to perform on a duplicate file by setting the **Move old file with Same UUID to New Folder** option in the configMgr. This option defines what action is performed on a file that is available at some other location in the AEM repository. This setting is available in the *com.adobe.fmdita.config.ConfigManager* bundle in the configMgr.

By default the **Move old file with Same UUID to New Folder** option is turned ON. This implies that when the file being uploaded is present at some other folder in the repository, then the existing file is moved to the current location and overwritten with the file being uploaded. If you do not select this option, then the file is overwritten at its existing location.

**Additional notes on working with UUID-based files**:

The following points must be considered while moving or copying content within the AEM repository:

-   When copying one or more files from one location to another location, a new UUID is generated for files not having any UUID. This UUID is added in the file's metadata.

-   If a file has a conflict or has a duplicate, then a unique filename is generated for the new file being copied or moved.

-   No two files can have the same UUID. A unique UUID is assigned to all new files.


The following points must be considered while moving or copying content from your local system to the AEM repository:

-   If in case a file is being uploaded by two different users at the same time, then the file that is processed later overwrites the earlier file. However, such a practice is rare and should be avoided.

-   When you checkout content from the AEM repository and make changes on your local system, ensure that the file name is not changed at the time of uploading the file.


## Use curl commands 

You can also use curl commands to create a folder in DAM, upload files, and add metadata on the uploaded content.

**Create a folder**

Run the following command to create a folder in AEM repository:

```curl
curl --user <username>:<password> --data jcr:primaryType=sling:Folder "<server folder path>"
```

Specify the following parameters to create a folder:

-   `<username>:<passowrd>`: Specify the user name and password to access the AEM repository. This user must have the folder creation privileges.

-   `jcr:primaryType=sling:Folder`: Specify this parameter *as is* to create a folder type resource.

-   `<server folder path>`: Complete folder path including the name of the new folder that you want to create in the AEM repository. For example, if you specify the path as `http://192.168.1.1:4502/content/dam/projects/AEM-Guides`, then the folder `AEM-Guides` is created within the `projects` folder in DAM.


**Upload a file**

Run the following command to upload a file in the AEM repository:

```curl
curl --user <username>:<password> -T "<local file path>" "<server folder path>"
```

Specify the following parameters to upload a file:

-   `<username>:<passowrd>`: Specify the user name and password to access the AEM repository. This user must have write privileges on the `server folder path`.

-   ``local file path``: Complete file path on your local system that you want to upload.

-   `<server folder path>`: Complete folder path on the AEM server where you want to upload the file.


**Add metadata**

Run the following command to add metadata on a file:

```curl
curl --user <username>:<password> -F<attribute name>=<value> <metadata node path>
```

Specify the following parameters to add metadata information:

-   `<username>:<passowrd>`: Specify the user name and password to access the AEM repository. This user must have write privileges on the ``metadata node path``.

-   ``-F<attribute name>=<value>``: The `<attribute name>` is the name of the metadata attribute, such as `audience` and the `<value>` could be `internal`. You can specify multiple attribute name-value pairs separated by space.

-   `<metadata node path>`: Complete folder path including the file name and its metadata node. For example, if you specify the path as `http://192.168.1.1:4502/content/dam/projects/AEM-Guides/intro.xml/jcr:content/metadata`, then the specified metadata information is set on `intro.xml` file.
