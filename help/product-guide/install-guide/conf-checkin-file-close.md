# Configure prompt to check in a file on close {#id222HC040PE8}

When the user tries to close a file that is opened in the Web Editor using the **Close** button on the file's tab or the **Close**option in the Options menu, a dialog appears if the file has unsaved data or an unsaved version. The user is prompted to unlock the file if it is locked.

The **Unlock the File** checkbox is not enabled by default and you need to enable this from the configMgr. Perform the following steps to enable the option by default in the Web Editor:

1.  Open the Adobe Experience Manager Web Console Configuration page.

    The default URL to access the configuration page is:

    ```http
    http://<server name>:<port>/system/console/configMgr
    ```

1.  Search for and click on the **com.adobe.fmdita.xmleditor.config.XmlEditorConfig** bundle.

1.  Select the **Ask for check-in on close** option.

1.  Click **Save**.


When this configuration is enabled, the **Unlock the File** checkbox is selected by default in the dialog box.

For more details, see *File close and save scenarios* section in the Using Adobe Experience Manager Guides as a Cloud Service guide.
