# Migrate non-UUID content without versions 

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
> You can choose this migration approach if you intend to ignore or not migrate the asset versions. 


1. Download and upload assets from the non-UUID instance to the UUID instance directly from the AEM Assets UI using Adobe tools like the AEM desktop app.

1. Ensure that you enable the DAM update asset workflow  and execute it on all the assets after importing the content for GUID creation.
