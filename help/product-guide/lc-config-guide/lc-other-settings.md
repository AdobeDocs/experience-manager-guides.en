# Configure other settings 

As an Administrator, you can also configure the following settings for the Learning course Authors and Publishers: 

- **Snippets**: You can configure snippets at a folder level to ensure Authors have access to the correct Snippets. Only Administrators can create Snippets in Experience Manager Guides, which can then be used by Authors in the Editor.  

    You can access Snippets from the left panel in the Editor.

- **Conditions**: As an Administrator, you can configureâ€¯standard DITA-supported conditional attributes at the global or folder levels. Authors then use configured conditions by simply dragging and dropping the desired condition onto their content.  

    You can access Conditions from the left panel in the Editor.

- **Variables**: You can define variables to make your content more portable, consistent, and easier to update. During output generation, variables are replaced with the values from the selected variable set, allowing you to produce customized outputs efficiently. 

    For details, view [Create a new variable](../native-pdf/native-pdf-variables.md#create-a-new-variable)  

- **Editor toolbar**: You can customize the Editor toolbar as per your organizational needs. For example, you may prefer to change the name of a toolbar button, change its location, and so on.  

    For details, view [Configure and customize the XML Editor](../cs-install-guide/conf-folder-level.md#configure-and-customize-the-xml-editor-id2065g300o5z).
