# REST API to work with DITA maps {#id175UB30E05Z}

The following REST API allows you to work with DITA maps in AEM Guides.

## Download DITA map with dependents 

A GET method that downloads a DITA map with all its dependents such as referenced topics, sub-maps, images, and DTDs used in the map and topics.

**Request URL**:
http://*<aem-guides-server\>*: *<port-number\>*/bin/fmdita/exportditamap

**Parameters**:
|Name|Type|Required|Description|
|----|----|--------|-----------|
|`ditamap`|String|Yes|Absolute path of the DITA map file in AEM repository.|
|`baseline`|String|Yes|The title of the baseline that is used to retrieve the versioned content. <br> **Note:** The value is case-sensitive. |

**Response values**:
A .zip file whose contents are written to the output stream of the response.

## Initiate export for DITA map with dependents 

A POST method that initiates an export for a DITA map with all its dependents such as referenced topics, sub-maps, images, and DTDs used in the map and topics. The status can later on be queried and the download URL can be retrieved once completed.

**Request URL**:
http:*//<aem-guides-server\>: <port-number\>/bin/dxml/async-export*

**Parameters**:
|Name|Type|Required|Description|
|----|----|--------|-----------|
|`ditamap`|String|Yes|Absolute path of the DITA map file in AEM repository.|
|`baseline`|String|No|The title of the baseline that is used to retrieve the versioned content. <br> **Note:** The value is case-sensitive.|
|`flatFS`|Boolean|No|\(Optional\) If set to true, then a flat structure of files is returned in the ZIP file. For example, if your DITA map refers to content in multiple folders, then all referenced files are pulled into a single folder. In case there are files with same name, then those files are renamed by adding a numeric suffix. All references \(in DITA map and topics\) are handled automatically, as they are updated based on the new location of files in the flat folder structure. If set to false, then the folder structure is maintained as is in the ZIP file. If the DITA map refers to files from multiple locations, then all those locations are also created in the ZIP file. When you restore the ZIP file, the exact folder structure is created at the destination location. <br> The default value for this parameter is false.|
