# February 2026 release of Product Training and Learning content  

This release note covers the new and enhanced features introduced in February 2026 release of Product Training and Learning content. In addition, all the reported issues and bugs have been resolved in this release, ensuring improved stability and performance.

## New enhancements

- **Support for subtitles**: You can now add subtitles to quizzes and topics using the new **Add Subtitle** option in **File Properties**, making learning content more descriptive and accessible.
- **Enable or disable negative scoring**: While configuring quizzes, you can now choose to enable or disable negative scoring. This flexibility allows you to enforce a minimum score of zero, even when negative marking is applied.
- **Delete widgets easily**: In addition to deleting quiz questions, you can now delete widgets—such as accordions, flip cards, and tabs—using the **right‑click > Delete** option, simplifying content management.
- **Pin answer choices**: You can now pin specific answer choices so their order remains unchanged, even when answers are randomized during SCORM output generation. This is especially useful for options like *All of the above* or *None of the above*.
- **Numerical question type**: A new numerical question type allows you to create quiz questions that accept numeric answers with validation and configurable error margins. This is ideal for math, science, and technical content where minor variations due to rounding or unit conversions are expected.
- **Sequential attempt for quiz questions**: A new setting for SCORM output lets you enforce sequential quiz attempts. When enabled, learners must answer each question before moving to the next. Navigation is restricted until the current question is completed, ensuring a guided and consistent learning experience.
