# Design a page layout {#design-page-layout}

When creating a PDF document, you would have different sections for presenting different types of information. For example, a PDF document would start from a front or cover page, which would have your company's logo, book title, or version information. Then there would be chapters, appendices, or glossary pages. Each section in a PDF document looks different and that is achieved by creating and customizing the page layout.

When you design your page layout, you can define the various elements that make up a page. For example, you can define the page size, margins, header and footer, orientation, and other page specifications on a page. The Native PDF Publishing feature allows you to design your page as per the [Page Media standards](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-page-3/). Most of the settings that are covered under the Paged Media standards can be easily customized using the Native PDF Publishing feature's user interface. For some other advanced-level formatting, you can use the Source view to write your own CSS code.

Once you have designed the page layouts, you need to associate these layouts with their respective sections in the PDF Page Layout settings. See the [Create and customize page layouts](components-pdf-template.md#create-customize-page-layout) section for details on how to create and open a page layout for customization.

## Types of page layouts {#types-of-page-layout}

A PDF document typically contains the following sections:

* Cover page
* Table of contents
* Lift of figures
* Lift of tables
* Chapter or topic pages
* Glossary
* Index
* Back page

These sections would need a corresponding page layout to present the information in a specific format. In addition, you can also have a blank page that is used as a filler to start a new chapter from an odd or even page. In that case, you can either use the default page layout or create a page layout for a blank page. See [Create a new page layout](components-pdf-template.md#create-page-layout) for more details.

The Page Layouts settings under the **Template>Settings** section allow you to define which page layout is to be used for different sections of your PDF. Each page layout can further have different first, right, or left page variants.

### Create the first, right, or left page layout variants {#page-layout-variants}

Different page layouts in your PDF template can be further customized by having different first, right, or left page layout variants. You can design these pages differently using the page layout designer.

>[!NOTE]
>
>If you want to have a single page layout for a section in your book, then you do not need to create the First, Right, or Left page layouts.

Consider the following points when creating the page layouts:

>[!NOTE]
>
>The following points have taken the Chapter page layout as an example. However, these points are valid for other page layouts as well.

* If you want to use a single page layout for all pages within a chapter, then you would create only a single chapter page layout without any variant.

* If you want to have a different look and feel for the first page for chapters in your book, then you need to create a First page layout variant for your chapters.

* If you want to have a different look and feel for every left and right side page of your book, then you need to create the Left and Right side variants for your chapter page layout.

* If you want your chapters to start from an odd or even page, then can choose to create a page layout for the blank page. This page layout is used to fill the gap between two chapters to ensure the chapter starts from the desired odd or even page.

    >[!NOTE]
    >
    >If you do not create a separate blank page layout, then the default page layout is used. For creating a page layout, See [Create a new page layout](components-pdf-template.md#create-page-layout).

The following example will walk you through the process of creating variants of a page layout:

1. Create a "Chapter" page layout using the steps given under "Create a new page layout" procedure.

    A blank Chapter page layout is created and added under the Page Layouts.

    By default, when you create a page layout, it is also opened up for editing. The following screenshot displays a blank (default) page layout:

    <img src="./assets/default-blank-page-layout.png" width="300">

    The header, footer, and content area in a template is created by default. You can easily customize these areas using the page properties, content properties, and various tools (like inserting images, fields, and more) given in the user interface.

    >[!NOTE]
    >
    >For advanced configuration, you can use the Source view and add your custom HTML and CSS code.

1. Mouse hover over the **Chapter** layout, and click **Options** to display the context menu.

1. Click or mouse hover over **Add Layout Variant** and choose the desired page layout (First, Left, or Right) that you want to create.

The selected page layout is created using a copy of the base Chapter layout. This means that if you have made any changes in the default Chapter page layout, the same changes are replicated in the variant page layout at the time of page layout creation.

## Work with the Page Properties of a page layout {#page-props-page-layout}

While designing a page layout, having control over various page properties is essential. The Native PDF Publishing feature encapsulates all major page properties under the Page Properties panel. The Page Properties panel provides access to various properties under the following sections:

>[!NOTE]
>
>The Page Properties panel encapsulates the properties and follows rules defined under the [Page Media standards](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-page-3/).

* **Page Size** : Specify the page size you want to use for the page layout. The Page Size dropdown list allows you to choose from over 15 page sizes. You can also create a page layout using a custom page size, see [Set the page size](#set-page-size) for more details.

* **Orientation** : Specify the page orientation to use for the page layout. You can choose from Portrait or Landscape page orientations. Note that you can choose to have different orientations applied to different page variants in a page layout. For example, if your content contains a wide table or a large image, then you can create a landscape page layout and apply that layout to the wider table or image.

* **View Rotation** : Specify the side or direction in which the original top side is represented after rotation. You can choose from Clockwise 90, Anticlockwise 90, or Anticlockwise 180 degrees. This is very useful in a situation wherein you want to use a combination of Portrait and Landscape layouts in your output. For example, you can use portrait as the generic page layout, and you can set a landscape page layout for rendering wide tables. In that situation, you can set to display the table content in Clockwise 90 degrees. That way the page will be oriented in landscape and the content will be rotated 90 degrees to maintain continuity in view. We will see how this is achieved as an example later in this section.

* **Page Numbering** :The page numbering, by default, is continuous in a PDF. For example, a PDF of 100 pages could have continuous page numbers from 1 to 100. You can also restart the numbering from a specific number in all the different sections or the first occurrence of a section.
    * **Restart from** : Specify the page number from where the numbering for this page layout will start. For example, you can set the page number to restart for every chapter. In that case, you need to set the restart from property to 1 on the First page layout variant of the chapter page layout. By default, the page numbering continues from the previous page. 

    * **Apply to the first occurrence only**: You can also start from a specific number only for the first occurrence of a section. For example, you can start only the first chapter from 1 and continue the page numbers for other chapters. 

* **Layout** : Specify page margins along with padding for top, bottom, left, and right sides. The following illustration explains how margins, padding, and borders are rendered around the content. Note that the margin at the top and bottom of a page contain the header and footer.

    <img src="./assets/margins-padding-illustration.png" width="300">

* **Background** : Include an image or a color as the background of your page layout. For an image, you can specify the height and width of the image along with repetition and position properties.

* **Footnote** : Specify the properties to display footnotes in your output. You can choose to specify the margins and padding properties along with a border style.

### Set the page size {#set-page-size}

The very first thing that you need to define in a page layout is the page size. In the Page Properties, there are over 15-page sizes that you can choose for a page layout. You can also create a custom page size by performing the following steps:

1. Open the required page layout for editing.

    >[!NOTE]
    >
    >See [Customize a page layout](components-pdf-template.md#customize-page-layout) section for opening a page layout for customization or editing.

1. In the right panel, click **Page Properties**.
1. In the **Page Size** drop-down list, select **Custom**.

    The Page Width and Page Height fields are displayed.

1. Enter the desired page dimensions in the **Page Width** and **Page Height** fields.

    >[!NOTE]
    >
    >Some of the most commonly used units are px (pixels), pt (points), rem, em, % (percentage), and in (inches).

### Use page orientation and view rotation {#page-orientation-rotation}

Let's look at an example wherein a combination of portrait and landscape page orientation and view rotation properties are used. In this example, we will create a PDF with default portrait orientation, but a table will be rendered in landscape orientation with content in Clockwise 90 degree view. The final output will look something similar to:

<img src="./assets/portrait-landscape-page-layouts.png" width="400">

In the above output, the Contact List information is presented in landscape mode with content also rotated in 90 degrees. The remaining content is displayed in the normal portrait mode.

To achieve this kind of output, we need to perform the following main tasks:

1. Create a page layout with Landscape orientation.

1. Change the **View Rotation** property to render content in 90&deg;.

1. Create a custom style to use the new page layout.

1. Add the style in the outputclass definition of the table that we want to render in the landscape page layout.

Perform the following steps to achieve the above tasks:

1. Create a page layout with Landscape orientation. 
    1. Create a "Landscape" page layout using the steps given under "Create a new page layout" procedure.

    1. In the right panel, click **Page Properties**. 

        <img src="./assets/page-properties-panel.png" width="300">
    1. Change the **Orientation** to **Landscape**. 

1. Change the View Rotation property to render content in 90&deg; clockwise direction. 

    1. Select **Clockwise 90&deg;** from the View Rotation dropdown list. 
    <img src="./assets/view-rotation-page-props.png" width="300">

    1. Click **Savel All** to save the updated page layout properties.

1. Create a custom style to use the new page layout.
    1. Expand the left sidebar and double-click on the template in which you want to create the style.
    
    1. Expand the Stylesheets section.
    
    1. Hover over the Layout stylesheet, and click the (_Options_ icon) … and choose Edit.

        The Layout stylesheet is opened for editing.

    1. Right click on **Other Styles** and choose **New Style**.
        <img src="./assets/stylesheet-other-new-style.png" width="300">

    1. In the Add Style popup, enter **landscape-style** in the **classname**.
        <img src="./assets/stylesheet-new-landscape-style.png" width="400">

    1. Click **Done**.
        
        A new style named `.landscape-style` is created and added at the end of Other Styles list.

    1. Double-click on the `.landscape-style` style to open it for editing.
    
    1. Expand the **Pagination** property.
    
    1. Enter `Landscape` in the **Page Layout** property.

        <img src="./assets/new-style-with-landscape-layout.png" width="500">

    1. Click **Savel All** to save the updated style properties.

1. Add the style in the `outputclass` definition of the table that we want to render in the landscape page layout.
    1. In a DITA file editor, open the file where you want to apply the new page layout.
    
    1. Find the `<table>` element, which is to be rendered in Landscape mode.
    
    1. In the breadcrumb, click on the table element to select the table.

        <img src="./assets/new-style-table-element.png" width="400">

    1. In the right panel, click and open the Content Properties panel.
    
    1. In the Content Properties panel, add a new **outputclass** property with **landscape-style** as property value.

        <img src="./assets/new-style-table-outputclass.png" width="300">

  1. Click **Savel All** to save the updated file.
  1. Generate the PDF output.

The final PDF will have the table content rendered in landscape mode as shown in the beginning of the example.

### Add a background image {#add-bg-image}

Based on your requirements, you might want to add a background image that appears on every first page of a Chapter (PDF) output. The Background properties under the Page Properties allow you to easily add a background image. You can choose to replicate this image across a page, and position the image anywhere in the top, bottom, or center area of the page.

For example, to insert a background image in the center part of your content area, then perform the following steps:

1. Open the required page layout for editing.

    >[!NOTE]
    >
    >See [Customize a page layout](components-pdf-template.md#customize-page-layout) section for opening a page layout for customization or editing.

1. Click anywhere in the content area.

1. In the right panel, click **Page Properties**.

1. Expand the **Background** section.

1. Click the browse button in the **Image Path** location field.

1. Browse to and select the image you want to use as the background image.

    The image is inserted and replicated to cover the entire page.

1. Change the image size by adjusting the height and width properties.

    >[!NOTE]
    >
    >You can enter either of the height or width properties, as the image is auto-scaled to maintain the aspect ratio.

1. Set the other properties to adjust the way you want the background image to appear.

    * **Background Repeat** : Specify whether you want the background to repeat or not.

    * **Background Position** : Specify a position for the background image on your page.

The following screenshot displays the background image with the Background Repeat property set to _no-repeat_ and Background Position property set to _center center_.

<img src="./assets/background-image.png" width="500">

## Work with page header and footer {#work-header-footer}

When you include information in a header or footer in a page layout that information is repeated on all pages using that page layout. Typically, the header area is used for chapter or topic title and the footer area is used for showing page numbers.

When you create a new page layout the header and footer area is created by default. You can do many customizations in the header and footer area of a page layout. For example, you can insert an image (like a logo), variables (containing dynamic information), or static content.

### Change the header and footer margins and lines {#header-footer-margins}

By default, the header and footer margins are set to 1 inch. You can change this default value by changing the Margin setting in the Page Properties panel. Perform the following steps to change the header and footer size:

1. Open the required page layout for editing.

    >[!NOTE]
    >
    >See [Customize a page layout](components-pdf-template.md#customize-page-layout) section for opening a page layout for customization or editing.

1. In the right panel, click **Page Properties**.
1. Expand the **Layout** section.
1. Click the lock icon next to the **Margin** property.
1. To change the header size, enter the desired value in the Top margin field.

    >[!NOTE]
    >
    >Some of the most commonly used units are px (pixels), pt (points), rem, em, % (percentage), and in (inches).

1. To change the footer size, enter the desired value in the Bottom margin field.

You can design the header and footer area to contain multiple lines. To do so, add a \<p\> tag using the Insert HTML Elements (<img src="./assets/insert-html-element-2.svg" width=25>) icon in the header or footer area.

| _Developer Corner_: <img src="./assets/developer-corner-icon.svg" width="25"> |
|---|

If you like to work directly with the CSS and HTML code, then you can change the margin values as shown in the following code snippet:

```css
…

<meta name="page-style" content="size:A4 portrait;margin-top:3cm;margin-right:30pt;margin-bottom:1in;margin-left:90px;" />

…
```

>[!NOTE]
>
>In the above example, different units are used to specify the margin values.

### Remove the header and footer {#remove-header-footer}

The header and footer overlay in the top and bottom margins. Technically, this means that if you want to have a header and footer in your page layout, you must reserve the required space in the top and bottom margins.

If you do not want a page layout to have a header and footer, then there are two ways to achieve this:

* If you want to retain the top and bottom margins, leave the header and footer area blank.
* If you do not want to retain the top and bottom margins (like designing the front and back cover of a magazine), then you can remove the margins by setting the top and bottom margin properties to 0. This leaves no space for the header and footer.

### Add an image or a logo in the header {#add-image-header}

Based on your requirements, you might want to add an image that appears in the header area (or any other part) of the page layout. There are two ways in which you can add an image in your page layout:

* Use an image from the template Resources.
* Use the \<Add Image\> tool in the page layout editor.

>[!NOTE]
>
>It is recommended to use the Resources folder to manage all your template assets like images or fonts.

To insert an image like your company's logo in the header area, perform the following steps:

1. Open the required page layout for editing.

>[!NOTE]
>
>See [Customize a page layout](components-pdf-template.md#customize-page-layout) section for opening a page layout for customization or editing.

1. Click the Edit Header (<img src="./assets/header-icon.svg" width="25">) icon to bring your cursor in the header area.

    Or, click inside the header area.

1. To add an image, choose anyone of the following methods:
  1. Click the **Inert Image** (<img src="./assets/insert-image-icon.svg" width="25">) icon in the toolbar; in the **Select Path** pop-up, browse to the image location and click **Select** to insert it in the header area.
  1. Drag and drop an image from the Resources folder into the header area.

The following screenshot shows a sample image added in the header area.

<img src="./assets/image-in-header-area.png" width="500">

Once an image is inserted, you can modify its attributes to give it the look and feel that you want. The easiest way of changing the way an image or any other element on your page layout looks, use the Content Properties panel. See [Work with Content Properties panel](#work-with-content-props) for the various properties that are available through the UI to customize.

### Add fields and metadata {#add-fields-metadata}

Fields are very useful when you want to insert a piece of information that is pre-defined. For example, you can include a Chapter Title field in your chapter's header area that is replaced with the actual chapter's title when published.

There are the following categories for fields that you can insert in your page layout:

* Date
* Time
* Topic Title
* Project Title
* Page Number
* Total Page
* Chapter Title
* Chapter Number
* Metadata

Each of these field categories contain different variations in which the field information can be inserted. For example, a Date field can have different variations such as `YYYY-MM-DD`, `MM/DD/YY`, `MM/DD/YYYY` and so on. Similarly, Page Number can have variations in the form of roman, decimal, or even locale-specific formats such as _Arabic_, _Devanagari_, _Hebrew_, and more.

In addition to the predefined fields, you can also add metadata information as variables or fields in your page layout. This metadata is stored in your source DITA map content, and it can be easily inserted in your page layout. 

You can also select the metadata properties from your assets and add them to the page layout. The asset metadata is then published for your PDF output. These metadata properties of the assets are set from the **Properties** page of the DITA map or bookmap file.

>[!NOTE]
>
> The metadata fields are displayed according to your selection of asset or map in the **From** dropdown.


<!--For more information, see [Add fields and metadata](design-page-layout.md#add-fields-and-metadata).-->

In the following example, we will insert a page number and a chapter title in the footer area of a page layout.

1. Open the required page layout for editing.

    >[!NOTE]
    >
    >See [Customize a page layout](components-pdf-template.md#customize-page-layout) section for opening a page layout for customization or editing.

1. Click the **Edit Footer** (![](./assets/footer-icon.svg)) icon to bring your cursor in the footer area.

    Or, click inside the footer area.

1. Insert a paragraph element by clicking the **Insert HTML Elements** (<img src="./assets/insert-html-element-2.svg" width=25>) icon, and selecting Paragraph from the list of elements.

1. Click the **Insert Fields** (![](./assets/insert-fields-icon.svg)) icon.

    The Fields pop-up appears.

1. Select the **Page Number** category from the Field list, the **default(1)** page number format from the Format list, and click **Insert**.

    <img src="./assets/insert-page-number-field.svg" width="400">

    >[!NOTE]
    >
    >You can also edit the format of all fields, except the default format. To do so, click the Edit icon next to the format that you want to edit, make changes, and click OK. For more information, see [Add fields and metadata](#add-fields-metadata).

    The default page number field is inserted in the footer area of the page layout.

    <img src="./assets/page-number-field-in-footer.png" width="400">

    The top breadcrumb lists the elements in which the information is stored.

1. Enter a blank space after the page number field and click the **Insert Fields** icon.

1. Select the **Chapter Title** category from the Field list, the **Chapter Title** format from the Format list, and click **Insert**.

    The _Chapter Title_ field, which is populated with the chapter's title at the time of publishing, is inserted in the footer area. At this time, the page number and chapter title fields are separated by a space.

    <img src="./assets/page-number-topic-title-near-footer.png" width="400">

1. To right-align the Chapter Title, perform the following steps:

    1. Click on the Field element on the breadcrumb to select the Chapter Title field.

    1. In the right panel, click the **Content Properties** (<img src="./assets/content-properties-icon.png" width=25>) icon.

    1. Expand the **Layout** properties section, and set the **Float** property value to **right**.
        <img src="./assets/float-prop-html-content.png" width="400">

        The Chapter Title field is aligned towards the right side of the page footer.
        <img src="./assets/topic-title-moved-right-footer.png" width="500">


| _Developer Corner_: <img src="./assets/developer-corner-icon.svg" width="25"> |
|---|

If you like to work directly with the CSS and HTML code, then you can also achieve this by going to the Source view of the page layout and making changes in the code. The following code snippet shows the same footer setting done through the code:

```css
…
<p>

<span data-field="page-number" data-format="default">1</span>

<span data-field="chapter-title" data-format="default" style="float: right">Chapter Title</span>

</p>
…
```

## Work with content area {#content-area}

The content area is the largest area in terms of content space. The content area is populated with your topic's content. In some special cases, you can add boilerplate content in the content area. This content is published at the specified location in your page layout. For example, the heading in your table of contents, glossary, and index can be added as boilerplate content, which is published "as is" in the final output. Another example is the chapter TOC, which is typically added on the first page of every chapter.

One of the most commonly used customizations in the content area is the multi-column layout. With the powerful page layout designer, you can customize specific pages to render in multiple columns, while keeping the content in other pages in a single column.

In the following sections, we will cover various scenarios to customize the content area.

### Add a chapter TOC {#add-chapter-toc}

A chapter table of contents serves as a quick reference for the readers to know what is in the chapter. Typically, a chapter TOC is added at the very beginning of a chapter. So, if you want to use a chapter TOC, then you can add it in the content area of the main chapter page layout or the first page layout variant of a chapter.

In the following example, we will insert a chapter TOC in the first page layout of a chapter:

>[!NOTE]
>
>For this procedure, it is assumed that you have created the First page variant for a chapter page layout. For instructions on how to create a page variant, see [Create the first, right, or left page layout variants](#page-layout-variants).

1. Open the required page layout for editing.

    >[!NOTE]
    >
    >See [Customize a page layout](components-pdf-template.md#customize-a-page-layout) section for opening a page layout for customization or editing.

1. Place the cursor in the content area of the page layout.

1. Click the Chapter TOC (<img src="./assets/chapter-toc-icon.svg">) icon.

    The default chapter TOC is inserted in the content area.

    <img src="./assets/chapter-toc-default.png" width="400">

    >[!NOTE]
    >
    >The default chapter TOC contains headings 1 to 4. Here, Heading 1 is the Chapter Title itself. So, you may not want to have the chapter title again in the TOC or you may want to increase the level of headings that you want in the TOC. You can customize the TOC by changing the properties.

1. Open the Content Properties panel to customize the TOC heading levels.

    For example, if you want to start from Heading 2, then change the first drop-down list to start from 2.

    <img src="./assets/customize-chapter-toc.png" width="400">

    Similarly, if you want to have headings up till level 5, then change the second drop-down list to 5. The updated TOC will look as shown below:

    <img src="./assets/chapter-toc-updated.png" width="400">

    >[!NOTE]
    >
    >The final published PDF will only show the TOC entries based on the content in your chapters. If you don't have level 5 headings in a chapter, it will not be shown in the final output.

The look and feel of the default TOC can be customized using the stylesheets. The style starting with `chaptoc-level-#` (like `chaptoc-level-1`, `chaptoc-level-2`, and so on) are used to customize the styles for the chapter TOC. <!--For more details on the stylesheet elements used in the TOC and how to customize them, see _Customize default chapter TOC_-->.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>Currently, if you make any style updates in a stylesheet, it might not reflect in the content preview. However, the output is rendered with the updated styles.

### Work with multi-column page layout {#multi-column-layout}

Multi-column page layouts are very common in publishing magazines or indexes in a book. The Native PDF Publishing feature allows you to easily split your document into multiple columns. Using different page layouts, you can choose to keep only a specific section divided into multiple columns while keeping the other sections in a single column (or normal) layout.

To create a page layout with multiple columns, perform the following steps:

1. Open the required page layout for editing.

    >[!NOTE]
    >
    >See [Customize a page layout](components-pdf-template.md#customize-a-page-layout) section for opening a page layout for customization or editing.

1. As the multi-column layout is applied on the content, excluding the header and footer area, you need to select the content element in the breadcrumb.

    Once you select the content breadcrumb, the Content Properties panel will show the properties for Multiple Columns.

    <img src="./assets/multiple-columns-properties.png" width="400">

1. Use the multiple column properties to customize the multi-column page layout:

    * **Column Count:** Specify the number of columns to divide the page. Use the up and down arrow icons or enter a number to set the number of columns.
    
    * **Column Width:** Specify the width of a column in a multi-column layout. By default, the size is set in pixels (px), you can also specify it in pt, rem, em, %, or in units.

        >[!NOTE]
        >
        >If you don't specify a size, then the columns are uniformly divided to fit in the given page. In most cases, you don't need to specify this value.

    * **Column Gap** : Specify the space between individual columns.
  
    * **Column Span** : If you want any element on your page layout to span across columns, then you need to use this property. This is achieved by modifying the style of the desired element using the Stylesheets. <!--for more information see _Section explaining style customization_-->.

    In your page layout, if you want a certain text to appear on the first page of all chapter page layouts, then you can add it to the First page variant of the Chapter page layout.

    As shown in the following example, the Span Column property for the heading text is set to all. This ensures that even though the document is multi-column, the heading spans across columns.

    <img src="./assets/element-span-across-columns.png" width="400">

    >[!IMPORTANT]
