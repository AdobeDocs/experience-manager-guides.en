# Adobe Experience Manager Guides legacy documentation

Starting with 2502 and 5.0 release, Adobe Experience Manager Guides features a new UI and an updated User Guide to enhance usability and streamline workflows. If you're using the latest version, refer to the [New User Guide](../product-guide/user-guide/intro.md) for the most up-to-date information.

If you are using a previous version of Experience Manager Guides, the legacy documentation remains available to support your ongoing needs. You can continue to access the [Older User Guide](../legacy-product-guide/user-guide/intro-legacy.md) for previous UI workflows and features.
