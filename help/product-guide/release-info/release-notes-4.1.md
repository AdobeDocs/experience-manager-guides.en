## New features and enhancements

AEM Guides provides many enhancements and new features in the 4.1 release:

### Native PDF publishing

Support for creating a native PDF has also been added in the 4.1 release of AEM Guides. A new publishing engine has been introduced with the following features:
* Create a CSS template
* Create different page templates
* Design PDF templates comprising CSS and page templates
* Publish map and topic content in PDF format 

### Support for knowledge base site path in Article-based publishing

AEM Guides provides the article-based publishing feature to incrementally generate an output of one or more topics or publish your content to a knowledgebase platform. With the 4.1 release, you have an additional option to choose the Knowledge Base site path to which the topic/map needs to be published. Once you select the path, the output is generated at the specified path.  

### Enhanced Web Editor

* **Improved key resolution**

A DITA content key reference inserts a part of content from one topic into another. It uses a key to locate the content. The key references associated with a DITA topic need to be resolved. The selected root map takes the highest precedence to resolve key references. 

![user preferences dialog](assets/user-preferences.png)

Now the key references are resolved on the basis of the root map set in the following order of priority: 

1. User Preferences
1. Map View panel 
1. Folder Profile

For more details, see *Resolve key references* section in the Using Adobe Experience Manager Guides guide.

* **Add a custom panel in the left panel**

Now you can add a custom panel within the left panel of the Web Editor. You can use a custom panel for various purposes like providing help or doing the testing for a project. If a custom panel has been configured, then it also appears in the list of panels within the **Editor Settings**. You can toggle the switch to show or hide the custom panel.

* **Ability to change the document state of topics in a DITA map**

Now you can easily change the document state of selected topics within a DITA map. You can also open and edit the properties of selected topics in a DITA map from the **More Options** menu at the bottom of the Map View panel.

![selected topic properties](assets/map-view-properties.png)

* **Version information displayed in the Preview mode**

The Web Editor helps you in managing your versions. Now you can also see the version of the active topic or DITA map in the top right corner of the topic's file tab in the Preview mode of a topic.

![preview version](assets/preview-version.png)


* **Improved Web Editor refresh behavior**

The following  enhancements are now available with the browser refresh operation in the Web Editor:

* Now you get the support to refresh the browser while you edit your 
content in the Web Editor. If you hit the browser refresh icon while one or more files with
unsaved changes are opened for editing, you are prompted to save your files or cancel the refresh action. 

* Even on refreshing the browser, the views of the left panel and the right panel are retained.  

* The active topic or DITA map is reopened in the content editing area.

* **Create maps based on customized templates** 

Now you get the powerful feature to create customized map templates. You can use them to create DITA maps along with the topic templates and map templates referenced in the map template. 

![dita templates](assets/dita-templates.png)

You can also refer to other map templates and topic templates from the customized map template. The referred map templates can refer to various map templates, topic templates, topics, maps, images, videos, and other assets.

![create dita templates](assets/create-dita-template.png)

The customized map template can help you very easily replicate the map templates and the entire referred folder structure. These customized templates are especially useful to create and recreate multiple maps which have recursive structures and references. 

* **Schematron support**
“Schematron” refers to a rule-based validation language used to define tests for an XML file. Using a Schematron file you can define certain rules and then validate them for a DITA topic or a map. Web editor supports Schematron files. You can import the Schematron files and also edit them in Web Editor. The Schematron support in the Web Editor helps you in validating the files against a set of rules and maintaining consistency and correctness across the topics. 

![validate schematron](assets/schematron-validate.png)

* **Improved dialog on file close**

AEM Guides prompts you to save your changes and unlock your locked files when you try to close a file opened in the Web Editor. The prompts are displayed based on the **Ask for check-in on close** and **Ask for new version on close** settings configured by your administrator.

Based on the configuration, you get the option to save the changes and create a new version of your document. Or, you can also check in the file and save the changes to the current version.  

![File close](assets/file-close-save-changes-unlock.png)

For more details, see *File close and save scenarios* section in the Using Adobe Experience Manager Guides guide.* The **Insert Keyword** feature has been improved. You can now more easily find a Keyword to be inserted as the keywords are listed in alphabetical order. You can also search keyword(s) by typing a search string in the Search box. 

![insert keyword](assets/insert-keyword.png)

* **Support for Markdown documents**
Markdown is a lightweight markup language that can help you add formatting elements to plain text documents. The Web Editor allows you to use Markdown documents (.md) along with your DITA documents. You can easily author and preview a Markdown document in the Web Editor and also add it in your map file through DITA map editor.  For more details, see *Author Markdown documents from the Web Editor* section in  Using Adobe Experience Manager Guides guide.

![support markdown](assets/create-markdown-dita-topic.png)

* **Ability to configure a default tags view**
If a user enables the Tags View from the Web Editor, it remains enabled even across the sessions.  This means that you don't have to enable the Tags View again to access it later. Your administrator can configure the default state for the Tags View in the Web Editor. The default value for Tags View for a new user's session is determined by the tagsView property in the ui_config.json file.

* Now in the Repository View files are loaded in batches. All the files present in the main or `/content/dam folder` are listed. But from the next level or the secondary folder 75 files are loaded at a time. This batch loading is efficient, and you can access the files faster in comparison to loading all the files existing in a folder.

![load more files](assets/load-more-files.png)

### New Baseline dashboard

AEM Guides 4.1 release provides the Baseline feature integrated inside the Web Editor. You can now create baselines from the Web Editor and use them to publish or translate topics of different versions.

**Note**: For upgraded system, please update the latest **ui_config.json** for Folder Profile.

Use this feature to create a baseline with a specific version of the topics available on a specific date and time. Also, you get the API support to create or update a baseline with a label defined for a version of topics. 

![baseline manage tab](assets/baseline-manage.png)

You can search the files based on filenames, or file location. You can also filter the topics to be displayed in the baseline editing window and sort them based on specific columns. 

![baseline manage tab](assets/baseline-filter.png)

The performance for the baseline creation process has been further improved. The process to create baselines is asynchronous, so you can continue editing other files in the Web Editor while the baseline is being created. For more details, see *Create and manage baselines from the Web Editor* in the Using Adobe Experience Manager Guides guide. 

Note: The Baseline tab on the map dashboard is hidden by default. Your administrator can enable the Baseline tab on the map dashboard.

* The baseline parameter in the APIs to Download Map now uses the title of the baseline to retrieve the versioned content.

### Improved Translation Process

* **Ability to create a scoping translation project**
If you need to create only the scope for a project to be translated, you can select **Create a new scoping translation project**. This will not send the copies for translation and the original translation status of the files is maintained. 
 
![scoping translation project](assets/scoping-translation-project.png)

* The **Languages** list displays the language folders along with their language codes. For example, French (fr) and German (de).

![translation languaged](assets/translation-languages.png)

For more details on translation, see *Translate documents from the Web Editor* section in  Using Adobe Experience Manager Guides guide.


### Enhanced Publishing

* You can also access the **Publish Dashboard** from the Outputs tab while you generate output from the map dashboard. A list of all active publishing tasks is available in the Publish Dashboard. 

![queued outputs](assets/queued-output.png)

* From the map dashboard you can select multiple DITAVAL files to generate conditionalized content. You can maintain the file order by adding or deleting files. You can also hover over the file name to see the path in the AEM repository where the file is stored. 

* Baselines have been honored for the metadata of AEM site output. You can also process the properties of a baseline version as metadata. If no baseline is defined, then the properties of the latest version are processed as metadata.

* The **File Name** and **DITA-OT Command Line Arguments** options have been added for HTML5, EPUB, and Custom output presets. Now you can specify the file name with which you want to save the output. You can also specify the additional arguments that you want DITA-OT to process while generating output.

### Map dashboard

When you select to download the DITA map, the request is queued, and you receive a notification once the map is ready to download. You can choose to download the map file immediately or download it later from the link provided in the AEM notification Inbox. 

![Map download](assets/download-map-prompt.png)

### Other Feature Enhancements

* AEM Guides now supports Oxygen XML Author version 24.1.
* The baseline parameter in the APIs to Download Map now uses the title of the baseline to retrieve the versioned content.

### Deprecated Feature

AEM Guides no longer supports the generation of DITA output format for FrameMaker documents. This DITA option has also been removed from the Output Presets of the Map dashboard.
