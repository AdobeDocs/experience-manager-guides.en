## Configure custom image renditions for specific output presets

You can now configure different image renditions for individual output presets under the same output type by using the `outputName` attribute in `renditionmapping.xml`. This enhancement gives you greater flexibility when publishing content that requires varying image resolutions for different scenarios. For example, you might want a high-resolution image for your main HTML5 output while using a smaller thumbnail for a lightweight preset.
