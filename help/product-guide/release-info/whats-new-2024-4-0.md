# Create translation groups to translate into multiple languages

Experience Manager Guides allows you to translate your content into a group of languages. This feature helps you organize and manage translations according to the needs of your organization. For example, if you need to translate your content for some countries in Europe, you can create a language group for European languages like English (EN), French (FR), German (DE), Spanish (ES), and Italian (IT).

*Select the language groups or languages in which you want to translate your documents.* 

Your admin can create language groups and configure them to particular folder profiles. As a user, you can view the language groups that are configured to your folder profile.


Overall, creating language groups enhances the efficiency and scalability of translation projects, ultimately improving the localization process across multiple languages.
