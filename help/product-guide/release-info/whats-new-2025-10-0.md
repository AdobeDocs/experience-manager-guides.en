## Editor settings is now renamed to Workspace settings and accessible from the Homepage

To improve clarity and usability, **Editor settings** in Experience Manager Guides has been renamed to **Workspace settings**.

Additionally, the **More actions** menu (the three-dot menu), previously available only in the Editor and Map console interface, is now accessible from the **Homepage**. With fewer clicks and direct access to key actions, this update enhances workspace navigation and improves overall efficiency.

## Access status report of review tasks directly from the Review panel

As an initiator of a review task, you can now check the status report of your review task directly from the Review panel. With the latest enhancements, the **Update task** dialog within the Review panel includes a new **Check review status** option. Selecting this option takes you directly to the status report of your review task in the Review dashboard, enabling quicker access to task's progress without switching contexts.
