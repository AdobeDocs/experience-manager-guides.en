## Enhanced incremental output with Baseline support

The incremental output generation process has been enhanced to support publishing specific versions of topics defined in the selected baseline for AEM sites, ensuring accurate propagation of version metadata. This improvement brings greater consistency and traceability to published content. Additionally, to maintain the integrity of baseline-driven regeneration, warning logs are now generated when topics or maps outside the defined baseline are selected for regeneration, helping users identify and address unintended content inclusion.

For more details, view [Incremental output generation](../user-guide/generate-output-aem-site.md).
