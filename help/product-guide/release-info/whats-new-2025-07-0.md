## Enhanced incremental output generation with version-specific topics

The incremental output generation process has been enhanced to support publishing specific versions of topics defined in the selected baseline for AEM sites using legacy component mapping, ensuring accurate propagation of the content in the output. This improvement brings greater consistency and traceability to published content.
