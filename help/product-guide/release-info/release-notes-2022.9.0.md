# September release of Adobe Experience Manager Guides as a Cloud Service 

## Upgrade to the September release

Upgrade your current Adobe Experience Manager Guides as a Cloud Service (later referred as *AEM Guides as a Cloud Service*) setup by performing the following steps:
1. Check out the Cloud Services' Git code and switch to the branch configured in the Cloud Services pipeline corresponding to the environment that you want to upgrade.
1. Update `<dox.version>` property in `/dox/dox.installer/pom.xml` file of your Cloud Services Git code to 2022.9.178.
1. Commit the changes and run the Cloud Services pipeline to upgrade to the September release of AEM Guides as a Cloud Service.

## Steps to index the existing content 

Perform the following steps for indexing the existing content and use the new find and replace text at map level:
* Run a POST request to the server (with correct authentication) - `http://<server:port>/bin/guides/map-find/indexin`. 
(Optional: You can pass specific paths of the maps to index them, by default all maps will be indexed ||  Example :   `https://<Server:port>/bin/guides/map-find/indexing?paths=<map_path_in_repository>`)
* The API will return a jobId. To check the status of the job, you can send a GET request with job id to the same end point - `http://<server:port>/bin/guides/map-find/indexing?jobId={jobId}` 
(For example: `http://<_localhost:8080_>/bin/guides/map-find/indexing?jobId=2022/9/15/7/27/7dfa1271-981e-4617-b5a4-c18379f11c42_678)`
* Once the job is complete, the above GET request will respond with success and mention if any maps failed. The successfully indexed maps can be confirmed from the server logs.

## New features and enhancements

AEM Guides as a Cloud Service provides many enhancements and new features in the September release:


### Create a dynamic baseline based on labels

Now AEM Guides provides you the feature to create dynamic baselines based on labels. If you generate a baseline, download a baseline, or create a translation project using a baseline, the files are picked dynamically based on the updated labels. This feature is handy as you don’t have to modify the baseline when updating the labels. 
You can also export the snapshot of the baseline as a  CSV.

### Find and replace the text at map level

You can now search for files within a map that contain specific text. The searched text is highlighted in the files. You can also replace the searched word or phrase with another word or phrase within the files. 
Select the **Replace** icon to replace the current occurrence and the **Replace all in file** icon to replace all occurrences in the selected file.

![Find Replace in map](assets/map-find-replace.png)

By default, the options **Checkout file before replace** and **Create new version after replace** are selected, so a file is checked out before you replace the text, and a new version is created after the text is replaced.

### View version difference for Out of Sync files from the translation dashboard

You can now choose to translate the **Out of Sync** files based on the changes done between the two versions of a topic.

From the translation dashboard, you can easily see the differences between the last translated version and the current version of the selected file.

Based on the differences, you can decide whether you want to translate a topic or not.

### Metadata UI available for PDF Presets  

You can set the metadata from the output preset of a DITA map. You can set the Title, Author, Subject, and Keywords metadata. This metadata is mapped to the metadata in the File Properties of your output PDF. 
This metadata overrides the metadata defined at the book level. You can define the metadata specifically in each output preset and pass it on to the output PDF.
