### FMPS

For FMPS installation you can refer given [YouTube link ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2deelyM5VA8&t) or [FMPS installation & configuration ](https://help.adobe.com/en_US/framemaker/server/index.html#t=fmps-user-guide%2Finstall_config_fmps.html%23install_config_fmps&rhtocid=_2)

## Required Configurations

FrameMaker Publishing Server (FMPS) can be used to generate your DITA content. FMPS supports a wide range of output formats. Modify the following properties of the "com.adobe.fmdita.config.ConfigManager bundle" in the Web Console to configure AEM Guides to use FMPS.

To open the Web Console, go to the URL Access http://\<server name\>:\<port\>/system/console/configMgr.

**Configuration properties and their description** [4.1 installation and configuration ](https://helpx.adobe.com/content/dam/help/en/xml-documentation-solution/4-1-2/Adobe-Experience-Manager-Guides_Installation-Configuration-Guide_EN.pdf#page=89)

## Running Test:

Using FMPS, you may automatically publish **PDF, Responsive HTML5**, and **Epub** for your DITA and FM Assets.

From the "Generate PDF using" menu, choose FrameMaker Publishing Server.

The user can provide "settings File(.sts)" and "ditaval". Filtering is done using ditaval based on the conditions you supply.

-   **Setting file**: A FrameMaker /FMPS Publish setting file that contains all of the settings that you want FMPS to respect when publishing. For instance, creating output with a customised template, creating Marks and Bleeds (PDF), and creating PDF with TOC.
-   **FMPS preset:** It is pre-defined combination of ditaval and settings file. Instead of giving separate ditaval and settings files, the User can pre-create FMPS preset which can be re-used for publishing needs.

**Note:** The default system setting is be used by FMPS to publish if you don't choose any of the settings or the FMPS preset.

It is a conflict if you chose the FMPS preset and also provided custom settings or a ditaval file from AEM. In this case, the FMPS preset takes precedence over the custom settings or ditaval file.

### Baseline Publishing using FMPS:

You can publish your already created baselines with FMPS2020.0.2 or higher version.

## FAQ and Troubleshooting:

-   ### FMPS publishing fails with "Timeout Exception"

>Check and increase the value of "FMPS timeout" (Seconds) in /system/console/configMgr/com.adobe.fmdita.config.ConfigManager"

-   ### Unable to get FMPS preset in the dropdown

>Make Sure you have a pre-defined FMPS preset created on Server and that your connection settings are correct.

-   ### I am getting Blank PDFs when publishing

>If you are using UUID, then make sure you have checked "Use UUID based referencing" in FrameMaker Edit Preferences and conversely for non-UUID AEM guides.

-   ### My settings/ditaval are not getting applied in the final published output 

>Verify that you are not simultaneously choosing the FMPS preset and the setting/diaval file. Use FrameMaker to manually check output.

-   ### The baseline not getting published from FMPS

>FMPS2020.0.2 or later versions are compatible with baseline publishing.
>Make sure that your baseline was properly created; to check, go to the Map Dashboard-- Topics-- Download  Map and choose "Use Baseline".
-   ### Publish Tasks from FMPS takes more time than other Engines

>When publishing from FMPS, the ideal fixed header time is approximately 3-4 minutes; if you believe it is longer, check with your FMPS administrator or contact Adobe Support.
