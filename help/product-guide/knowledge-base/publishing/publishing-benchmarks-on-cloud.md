# AEM Guides Publishing Benchmarks on AEMaaCS

Currently AEM Guides cloud service has some limits on publishing map sizes which Guides team is actively working to resolve.

Guides team has introduced a scalable publishing microservice to support large maps and multiple concurrent publishing. To learn more about the new publish microservice refer [publishing microservice architecture](publish-microservice-architecture-and-performance.md)

To configure the new publishing service for any AEM cloud environment refer [configure new microservice-based publishing](configure-microservices.md)

## Key points to remember

- AEM Site creates many cq:Page nodes and flattens by rendering them individually during generation time. For this reason, it is advisable to avoid running large multiple concurrent AEM Site publishings as it can overburden the system.
- AEM Site generation time depends on the template used. Execution time can increase if complex template is used.
- Custom publishing execution time is for a sample custom output. Custom publishing time solely depends  on customer's own transformation logic.
