# External Datasource Integration for AEM Guides: How it works?

Many enterprise customers have data distributed across multiple databases, but there is often a need to have the data integrated within AEM guides as a single source from where the data can be processed.
Adobe Experience Manager Guides now include out-of-the-box connectors to external data sources â€” including JIRA, PIMs, SQL Data Bases, and PLMs making it a true Content Hub.
