# "Delta" content migration

This is the third session in the series about content migration for AEM Guides. 
In this session, we will cover the recommended steps of "delta" content migration from one environment to other (on-prem to on-prem and cloud to cloud). 
Since we know that delta migration is about transfering content between two existing environments that have same base content, and migration is needed to sync the changes to previously migrated content - hence corresponding scenarios will be covered.
