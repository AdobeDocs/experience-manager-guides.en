# Repository 

The Repository feature serves as a centralized place designed to enhance the discoverability and management of folders and files. It offers a comprehensive view of all repository contents while enabling advanced customization for improved information access. 

This unified interface streamlines multiple functions, including creating new maps or folders, uploading assets, editing files, and executing precise searches with robust filtering options, thereby ensuring efficiency and ease of use.

## Repository View

It consists of the following:

**Tab bar**

The Tab Bar, located at the top of the Repository view, provides quick access to essential actions:

- **Folder navigation panel**: Displays a hierarchical, tree-like structure of folders within the Repository, enabling seamless navigation. This panel shows folder-level information only. When a folder is selected from here, its contents, files and, sub-folders are displayed in the main view.
it also offers navigation through breadcrumbs as shown below. You can use the breadcrumbs to traverse to the required location directly.
