# Tab bar in the Editor 

The Tab bar is at the top of the Editor's interface and it provides access to the following features:

![](./images/web-editor-tab-bar.png)

**Tabs**

Displays the currently opened topics in the Editor as file tabs. You can have multiple topics opened at the same time, which are displayed in their respective tabs in the tab bar. By default, you can view the file titles in the tabs. As you hover over a file, you can view the file title and the file path as a tooltip.

>[!NOTE]
>
> As an administrator, you can also choose to view the list of files by filenames in the tabs. Select the **Filename** option of the **Editor files display configuration** section in [User preferences](./intro-home-page.md#user-preferences).

Selecting the file tab opens a context menu featuring Save as new version, Copy, Locate in, Add to, Properties, Split, Download as PDF, and Close options. 

**Save all** 

Saves the changes you have made in all opened topics. If you have multiple topics opened in the Editor, selecting **Save all** or using the **Ctrl**+**S** shortcut keys saves all documents in one click. You do not have to individually save each document.

>[!NOTE]
>
> The **Save all** operation does not create a new version of your topics. To create a new version, use the **Save as new version** option.

**AI Assistant**

A powerful, AI-driven tool designed to enhance your productivity through smart help and authoring features. It brings together two robust AI features — **Authoring** and **Help** — into the Experience Manager Guides interface, enabling you to author content and access information from Experience Manager Guides documentation faster and more efficiently. 

>[!NOTE]

> The AI Assistant feature is currently available for Adobe Experience Manager Guides as a Cloud Service.

**Expand view**: Allows you to expand the page view using the **Expand** icon. In this view, the header bar containing the Adobe Experience Manager logo, is hidden. This maximizes the content space for editing. To return to the standard view, use the **Exit the expanded view** icon.

**More actions**: Provides access to additional options. Selecting this button opens a menu with the following options:

- **Assets**: Takes you to a destination based on your setup.
   - **Cloud Services**: If you are using Cloud Services, selecting the **Assets** option takes you to the AEM Navigation page.

   - **On-premise Software**: If you are using Adobe Experience Manager Guides (4.2.1 and later), selecting the **Assets** option takes you to your current file path in the Assets UI.
- **Workspace settings**: Takes you to the Workspace settings dialog. For details, refer to [Configure Workspace settings](../cs-install-guide/workspace-settings.md). 

>[!NOTE]
>
> If using the Adobe Experience Manager Guides in an On-Premise setup , the Workspace settings option continues to appear as **Settings** under the More actions menu.
