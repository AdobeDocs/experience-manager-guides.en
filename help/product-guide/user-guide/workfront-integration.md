# Workfront integration

Adobe Workfront is a cloud-based work management solution that helps teams and organizations plan, track and manage their work efficiently. The integration between Experience Manager Guides and Adobe Workfront gives you access to robust project management features on top of Experience Manager Guides core CCMS capabilities, allowing you to plan, allocate, and track tasks efficiently. 

With this integration, you can create and manage Adobe Workfront tasks directly from Experience Manager Guides. For example, as an author, you can create a review task (with one or more DITA topics or maps added) directly within the Experience Manager Guides interface and assign it to a reviewer. As a reviewer, you can work on assigned tasks in the Experience Manager Guides Review UI and return them to the author with comments. Similarly, you can create a publishing and translation task, and then assign it to the users who are required to work upon it.

The integration also provides you the ability to monitor your work queues, ensuring you stay organized and on top of all your tasks (assigned tasks).

**Key features**

With the Experience Manager Guides and Adobe Workfront integration, you can: 

* Plan, allocate, and track the progress of individual tasks and projects without relying on multiple, non-integrated tools. 
* Manage all Experience Manager Guides workflows including authoring, reviewing, publishing, and translating content more efficiently. 
* Receive email notifications from Adobe Workfront whenever new tasks are assigned. For more details, view [Notifications overview](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/workfront/using/basics/use-notifications/wf-notifications).
* Monitor project health using Adobe Workfront's intuitive dashboard, offering real-time insights into project performance.

## Working with Adobe Workfront assigned tasks

There are four types of Adobe Workfront tasks that you can create, and then assign, or work upon when assigned on Experience Manager Guides:

1. [Authoring tasks](#authoring-tasks)
2. [Review tasks](#review-tasks)
3. [Translation tasks](#translation-tasks)
4. [Publishing tasks](#publishing-tasks)

The following sections walk you through the detailed process of working on assigned Adobe Workfront tasks. 

### Authoring tasks

Perform the following steps to work upon an authoring task: 

1. Access the task either from the [Overview](#accessing-assigned-tasks-from-overview-section) section or [Assigned to you](#managing-tasks-assigned-to-you) tab. 

    ![Authoring tasks in the Assigned to you tab](./images/authoring-task-access.png){align="left"}
    
    *Authoring task in the Assigned to you tab*

    ![Authoring tasks in the Your tasks widget](./images/authoring-task-access-your-tasks.png){align="left"}
    
    *Authoring task in the Your tasks widget*
2. Hover over the task you want to work upon and select&nbsp; ![](images/Smock_OpenIn_18_N.svg)&nbsp; to open it. You can also open the task by simply selecting the task. 
   
   All authoring tasks open in the Editor. 
3. Review the task details in the **Details** tab and select the **Asset** file to open it. 

    ![](./images/authoring-task-review-details-editor.png){align="left"}

4. Make the required edits and select **Mark as done**. 
5. Switch to the **Comments** tab to add a comment to this task. These comments, added at task level, will also reflect on the Adobe Workfront project dashboard.  

    >[!NOTE]
    >
    > Once the task is marked as done, it will be removed from both your assigned task list and the task initiator's **Created by you** task list.  

### Review tasks

As a reviewer, you can review Adobe Workfront review tasks that are assigned to you. 

Perform the following steps to work upon a review task assigned to you.

1. Access the task either from the [Overview](#accessing-assigned-tasks-from-overview-section) section or [Assigned to you](#managing-tasks-assigned-to-you) tab. 

    ![Review tasks in the Assigned to you tab](./images/review-task-access.png){align="left"}
    
    *Review task in the Assigned to you tab*

    ![Review tasks in the Your tasks widget](./images/review-task-access-your-tasks.png){align="left"}
    
    *Authoring task in the Your tasks widget*
2. Hover over the task you want to work upon and select&nbsp; ![](images/Smock_OpenIn_18_N.svg)&nbsp; to open it. You can also open the task by simply selecting the task. 

    For reviewers, the review task opens in the **Review UI**. 
    
    ![](./images/review-task-access-review-ui.png){align="left"}

3. Perform the required review. For details on how to review a topic, view [review topics](./review-topics.md).
4. Once the review is complete, select **Mark as done**.
5. Switch to the **Comments** tab to add a comment to this task. These comments, added at task level, will also reflect on the Adobe Workfront project dashboard.  

Marking the task as done by the reviewer does not indicate the completion of the task. All review tasks are assigned back to the user who created the task (ideally an author who requested for a review). 

>[!NOTE]
>
> If the task is assigned to multiple reviewers, then it is re-assigned to the task creator only after all reviewers have marked it as done. 

Review tasks re-assigned to the creator/authors for review incorporation, can be accessed from [Overview](#accessing-assigned-tasks-from-overview-section) section or from [Assigned to you](#managing-tasks-assigned-to-you) tab. 

![Review tasks in the Author mode](./images/review-task-author-mode.png){align="left"}

*Review task assigned back to authors* 

For such tasks, the task state for the assignee changes to **Authoring** while the task type remains as **Review**. This state change happens when the review is completed by all the reviewers.

![](./images/review-tasks-with-authoring-doc-state.png){align="left"}

    
Selecting the task or the open icon ![](images/Smock_OpenIn_18_N.svg) opens the task in the Editor where the author can [address review comments](../user-guide/review-address-review-comments.md), edit the task by updating the version of the topics, and then re-assign the task back to reviewer if needed. 

Author can also edit the task and assign it to another author, delegating the task of incorporating the comments. To do this, select **Edit**, change the Task state to **Authoring**, and then select **Change assignee**. You can now select an assignee from the list.  

This process forms a continuous cycle, where the task moves back and forth between the author and reviewer until it is fully completed. Once all the suggested changes are incorporated, the author can complete the task by selecting **Mark as done**. 

### Translation tasks

You can perform various translation actions on Adobe Workfront translation tasks that are assigned to you. 

Perform the following steps to work upon a translation task: 

1. Access the task either from the [Overview](#accessing-assigned-tasks-from-overview-section) section or [Assigned to you](#managing-tasks-assigned-to-you) tab. 

   ![Translation tasks in the Assigned to you tab](./images/translation-tasks-access.png){align="left"}

    > Once the task is marked as done, it will be removed from both your assigned task list and the task initiator's **Created by you** task list.

### Publishing tasks

As a publisher, you can view details and publish a publishing task assigned to you.  

Perform the following steps to work upon a publishing task: 

1. Access the task either from the [Overview](#accessing-assigned-tasks-from-overview-section) section or [Assigned to you](#managing-tasks-assigned-to-you) tab.
