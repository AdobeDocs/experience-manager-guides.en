# Workfront Integration

Adobe Workfront is a cloud-based work management solution that helps teams and organizations plan, track and manage their work efficiently. The native integration between Adobe Workfront and Adobe Experience Manager Guides provides you with a unified workspace to seamlessly author and manage content, as well as allocate and track tasks.  

## Key features:

With the native Adobe Workfront integration, you can: 

* Plan, allocate, and track the progress of individual tasks and projects without relying on multiple, non-integrated tools. 
* Manage all Experience Manager Guides workflows including authoring, reviewing, publishing, and translating content more efficiently. 
* Receive task notifications through a configurable notification system whenever new tasks are assigned. 
* Monitor project health using Workfrontâ€™s intuitive dashboard, offering real-time insights into project performance. 
* Maintain a detailed audit trail to easily review and track key project activities from the past. 

# Get started

Once configured and enabled by your administrator, Workfront tasks can be accessed right from the [home page of AEM Guides](./intro-home-page.md). 

Perform the following steps to access your Workfront tasks: 

1. Log into Experience Manager Guides and open the **Home page**.  
2. Go to Your Tasks widget that displays a list of Workfront tasks that are assigned to you and in open state. You can also navigate to the Workfront section in the  Left panel. This takes you to the Workfront tasks page wherein you can view the tasks assigned to you and created by you in two separate tabs.
