# Content translation overview {#id1645H700L67}

Adobe Experience Manager Guides comes with powerful capabilities that enable you to translate your content into multiple languages. Both, human and machine translation workflows are supported by Experience Manager Guides.

-   **Human translation** - Assets are sent to your translation provider and translated by professional translators. When complete, the translated assets are returned and they are then imported back into Adobe Experience Manager.

-   **Machine translation** - This is the default service in Adobe Experience Manager wherein the content is immediately translated using the machine translation in real time. Adobe Experience Manager provides the out-of-the-box capability to connect with the Microsoft Translator.

    >[!NOTE]
    >
    > Microsoft Translator is available only as a trial license.
