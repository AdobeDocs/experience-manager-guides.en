# Work with FrameMaker {#id221BH0L03XA}

FrameMaker supports authoring and publishing of the content in AEM Guides. FrameMaker ships with an out-of-the-box connector to Adobe Experience Manager. FrameMaker also provides you with an easy-to-use interface that allows you to maintain versions of your documents in a distributed and collaborative environment. You can author your content in FrameMaker and publish in different formats - PDF, HTML5, EPUB, and DITA. You can also perform the various file management operations like checkout, checkout with dependents, check-in, refresh, and so on. For more details, see [FrameMaker Help](https://help.adobe.com/en_US/framemaker/using/index.html).
