# Close review tasks as a Reviewer

The features explained in this article are available only if they have been configured by your administrator at the backend.  

As a Reviewer, 

You can close or reopen review tasks for those projects for which you are the Author (or initiator). Once the review is complete from all the all the reviewers, you can update the review task to mark it closed or re-request a review if needed. 

## Reopen a review task

When the reviewers of your review task complete the review, a review notification is sent to show that the review has completed. 
As a reviewer, you can view an indicator in the comments panel to show that the review has ended. The comments toolbar is not displayed, so you cannot highlight, strikethrough, insert text, or add comments. You can read a comment but cannot edit or delete any comments. You also cannot add a reply to the comments. You cannot view the contextual toolbar (used to highlight or strikethrough any text). The outdated comments icon is also not displayed in a completed review task.

However, you can search or filter any comments. You can also choose to show or hide conditions and display conditionalized content accordingly. You can download any attachments but cannot upload or delete any attachments for the comments.
