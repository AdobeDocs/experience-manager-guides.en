Experience Manager Guides also supports authoring using desktop tools like Adobe FrameMaker and Oxygen XML Editor. You can use these tools to author DITA content, to publish your documents in various formats, and to maintain the versions of your documents.

**Work with FrameMaker**

FrameMaker also provides you with an easy-to-use interface that allows you to maintain versions of your documents in a distributed and collaborative environment. You can author your content in FrameMaker and publish in different formats - PDF, HTML5, EPUB, and DITA. You can also perform the various file management operations like checkout, checkout with dependents, check-in, refresh, and so on.
