# Review topics or maps {#id1645H6010Q5}

Almost all technical documents need to go through multiple rounds of reviews. In most cases, a review cycle involves more than one reviewer. Addressing and responding to comments from multiple reviewers is always challenging for authors. Also, in a multiple reviewer scenario, it is helpful if one reviewer can also see the comments made by other reviewers.

Some of the main features offered by AEM Guides to the *initiators \(or authors\)* are:

-   Create a DITA project for the review workflow.
-   Send one or more topics for review in a single review task.

-   Send a topic for review in multiple review tasks.

-   Create a review task by selecting a DITA map or topic based on their latest version, version on date, or a label \(for topics\) and Baseline \(for map\).

-   Share an updated version of the topic for review from the Review Dashboard.

-   Access comments shared on different versions of topic.

-   Group and filter comments based on version of topic.

-   See side-by-side differences between different versions of topics shared for review.

-   Automatically import \(deleted or inserted\) comments into the version of topic that was shared for review.


Features available to the *reviewers*:

-   Get one composite view of the topics shared for review.
-   Switch between composite view and individual topic view.
-   Use the commenting tools, such as text insertion, deletion, highlight, and note/comment to provide their feedback.
-   Attach one or multiple files to a review comment.
-   Download attachments from a comment.
-   Use the Review Panel to add comments or respond to comments from other users.
-   Easily know the version of topic under review.
-   Receive a notification when a task is assigned to them for review.
-   See differences between older and newer version of topic shared for review.
-   See comments made by other reviewers or replies on comments from author in real time.
-   Access comments given on older version of topic.
