# Use condition presets {#id1825FL004PN}

You can define attributes in your DITA topics and the use the condition preset to specify what happens with the attribute in the final output. For example, you can add attributes as version 1.0 and version 2.0 in your content, and use a condition preset to include version 1.0 for release 1.0 and exclude version 2.0. Similarly, you can add attributes as OS Windows and OS Linux to your content, and then include or exclude the relevant content for your final output according to the operating system.

You can create condition presets in two ways:

* From the Web Editor: Allows you to create and manage the condition presets for a DITA map from the Web Editor. 
* From the map dashboard: Allows you to create and manage the condition presets for a DITA map from the map dashboard.


## Condition presets from the Web Editor

Experience Manager Guides allows you to manage condition presets from the Web Editor and use them within the Output presets to generate the final output.
You can create and view the condition presets, view the attributes, and manage the actions for the current map from the **Condition Presets** view in the Web Editor.
