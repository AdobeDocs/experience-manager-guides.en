# Header bar in the Editor 

The header bar is the top bar of the Editor that displays the Adobe Experience Manager logo (or a Unified Shell if you are using the Unified Shell as your Experience Manager Guides UI). When you select the logo, it directs you to the Experience Manager Navigation page.

Use the **Expand** icon in the toolbar to hide the header bar and maximize the content area. To restore the standard view, select **Exit the expanded view**.
