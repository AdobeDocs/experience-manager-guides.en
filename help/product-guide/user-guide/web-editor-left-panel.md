> The features available in the left panel are managed by your administrator, allowing them to enable or disable the individual features present in the left panel. Only enabled features are displayed in the left panel. For more details, view the **Panels** section of [Tab bar](./web-editor-tab-bar.md). 

The detailed explanation of the left panel features is as follows:

## Collections 

If you work on a set of files or folders, you can add them to your favorite list to access them quickly. **Collections** show the list of documents that you have added and other publicly accessible list of documents from the other users.

By default, you can view the files by titles. As you hover over a file, you can view the file title and the file path as a tooltip.

>[!NOTE]
>
> As an administrator, you can also choose to view the list of files by filenames in the Editor. Select the **File name** option of the **Editor files display configuration** section in **User preferences**. 

<details>
    <summary> Create a new collection </summary>


To create a new collection, Select the + icon next to Collections panel to bring up the **New collection** dialog box:

![](images/favorite-new-collection.PNG){width="300" align="left"}

Enter a title and description for the collection that you want to create. If you select **Public**, then this favorite is shown to other users as well.

>[!NOTE]
>
> You can also create a collection from the Experience Manager Guides Home page. Open the home page, navigate to the **Collections** widget in the [Overview section](./intro-home-page.md#overview), and select **New collection**.  

</details>

<details>
    <summary> Add a file to collections </summary>


To add a file to collections, use any of the following methods:

- Navigate to the required file or folder in the Repository view, select the *Options* icon to open the context menu, and choose **Add to** > **Collections**. In the **Add to collections** dialog box, you can choose to add the file/folder to an existing favorite or create a new one.

    ![](images/favorite-add-file-folder.png){width="300" align="left"}

- Right-click on a file's tab in the editor to open the context menu. Choose **Add to** > **Collections** to add the file to your favorites list.

    ![](images/favorite-add-from-file-context-menu_cs.png){align="left"}
 

>[!NOTE]
>
> - To remove an item from the favorites list, select the Options icon next to the item in a Favorites collection and choose **Remove from collections**.
> - To preview the file without opening it, select a file and then select **Preview** from the Options menu. 

</details>

**Options menu for a collection**  

You can also perform many actions using the Options menu available for a Collection: 

![](images/favorites-options.png){width="650" align="left"}

- **Rename**: Rename the selected collection. 
- **Delete**: Delete the selected collection.  
- **Refresh**: Get a fresh list of files and folders from the Repository. 
- **View in Assets UI**: Show the file or folder contents in the Assets UI. 

>[!NOTE]
>
> You can refresh the list using the **Refresh** icon at the top. Additionally refreshing the list reloads the collections, and as a result, any expanded collections in the panel gets collapsed.


## Repository 

When you select the Repository icon, you get a list of files and folders available in DAM. By default, you can view the files by titles. As you hover over a file, you can view the file title and the file name as a tooltip.   

>[!NOTE]
>
> As an administrator, you can also choose to view the list of files by filenames in the Editor. Select the **File name** option of the **Editor files display configuration** section in **User preferences**.

75 files are loaded at a time. Each time you select **Load more**â€¦ 75 files are loaded, and the button stops being displayed when all the files have been listed. This batch loading is efficient, and you can access the files faster in comparison to loading all the files existing in a folder.

You can easily navigate to the required file within DAM and open it in the Editor. If you have the required access to edit the file, then you can do so.

You can also select and play an audio or video file in the Editor. You can change the volume or
the view of the video. In the shortcut menu you also have the options to download, change playback
speed, or view picture in picture.

Select a map and press Enter or double-click to open it in the **Map view**. For more details, view the **Map view** feature description in the left panel. Select a topic and press Enter or double-click to open it in the [Content editing area](./web-editor-content-editing-area.md). Being able to navigate and open a file directly from the Editor saves time and increases productivity. 

**Filter Search in Repository**

The Editor provides enhanced filters for searching text. You can search and filter for a text in the files present on the selected path of the Adobe Experience Manager repository. It searches in the title, filename, and content in the files.


![search files in repository view](images/repository-filter-search.png){width="300" align="left"}

*Apply filters to search for the files containing the text `personal spaceship.`* 

 Select the **Filter Search** \(![Search filter icon](images/filter-search-icon.svg)\) icon to open the Filter pop-up. 

>[!NOTE]
>
> When you search any text or filter any files, a blue dot appears on the **Filter Search**  \(![Search filter icon](images/filter-search-icon.svg)\) icon to indicate that we are on the search panel and that some filters have been applied.


You have the following options to filter the files and to narrow down your search in the Adobe Experience Manager repository:

- **DITA Files**: You can look for all **DITA Topics**, and **DITA Maps** present on the selected path. These are selected by default. 
- **Non-DITA Files**: You can search for **Ditaval Files**,  **Image Files**, **Multimedia**, **Documents**, and **JSON** in the selected path.

    ![quick search filter ](images/repository-filter-search-quick.png) {width="300" align="left"}

    *Use the quick filters to search for DITA and Non-DITA files.*

>[!NOTE]
>
> You can also use the **DITA Topic** filter to search for content specific to Markdown files in the repository, including titles, topic content, and properties. This feature currently applies only to newly created Markdown files.

**Advanced filtering**

Select the **Advanced filtering** ![advanced filter icon](images/advanced-filter-gear-icon.svg)icon to view the **Advanced filter** dialog box. 

You can view the following options under the **General** and **Advanced** tabs.

- **Locked by**: Displays a list of users. The list is paginated and loads asynchronously, showing a limited set of users at a time and fetching more as you scroll or navigate. This improves loading speed and overall performance, especially when working with a large number of users.
- **Modified after** / **Modified before**: Filter content based on modification date. Select a date range from the calendar or choose one of the following time frame options: 
    - In last two hours
    - In last week

    >[!NOTE]
    >
    >Your system administrator can also configure the text filters and show or hide other filters. For more details, view *Configure text filters* section in the Install and configure Adobe Experience Manager Guides as a Cloud Service.
    >
    >The list of filtered files that contain the searched text is displayed. For example, the files containing the text `personal spaceship` are listed in the previous screenshot. You can select multiple files from the filtered list to drag and drop them into a map opened for editing.

    ![](images/rename-move-asset.png){width="550" align="left"}

    >[!NOTE]
    >
    > You can also drag and drop a file to another destination folder.

    Experience Manager Guides doesn't allow you to rename or move a file in the following scenarios: 

    - You cannot move or rename a file if it's part of a review or a translation workflow. 

    - If any other user locks the file, you cannot rename or move it, you will not view the Rename or Move to option for the file. 

    >[!NOTE]
    >
    > If your administrator has given you the permissions on a folder, only then the **Rename** or **Move to** options are displayed.

>[!NOTE]
>
> You can also open and edit the properties of selected topics in a DITA map from the **More Options** menu under References.

## Reusable content

One of the main features of DITA is the ability to reuse content. The **Reusable content** panel can store your DITA files from where you generally insert reusable content. Once added, the DITA files remain in the Reusable content panel across sessions. This means that you don't have to add your DITA files again to access them later.

You can simply drag-and-drop reusable content from the panel onto your current topic and it gets inserted easily and quickly. You can also get a preview of the content before inserting it in your document.

By default, you can view the files by titles. As you hover over a file, you can view the file title and the file path as a tooltip.

>[!NOTE]
>
> As an administrator, you can also choose to view the list of files by filenames in the Editor. Select the **File name** option of the **Editor files display configuration** section in **User preferences**.

To add a DITA file to your Reusable content panel, use any of the following methods:

- Select the **+** icon next to Reusable content to open the browse file dialog box. Select the file that you want to add and then select **Add** to complete the process.

- In the Repository view, select the **Options** icon of the desired file and choose **Add to** > **Reusable content** from the context menu.

- Right-click on a file's tab in the editor to open the context menu and choose **Add to** > **Reusable content**.


Once the file is added, you can view all reusable content elements from the file in the Reusable content panel. Reusable content is shown with their IDs and element names.

When you add a file to the Reusable content list, the file's title is shown instead of the UUID of the file. To check the UUID of the file, mouse hover over the file's title and the UUID of the file is displayed in the tooltip.

![](images/uuid-reusable-content-file-title_cs.png){width="400" align="left"}

>[!NOTE]
>
> You can add multiple files to the reusable content list. Then you can insert the desired content from the Reusable content panel into your document.

**Refresh**: Rechecks for all reusable content and displays a fresh list of reusable content.

To insert content from the Reusable content panel, use any of the following methods:

- Hover the mouse pointer over an element that you want to insert, select the **Options** icon, and choose **Insert reusable content** from the dropdown.

    ![](images/insert-reusable-content_cs.png){width="400" align="left"}

    >[!NOTE]
    >
    > Select a file and then select **Preview** from the **Options** menu to preview the file without opening it. You can also preview the references present in a topic. The reference ID appears in the window. 
    >
    > The **Preview** option is also available in the **Options** menu of an element, which gives you a quick preview of the element before inserting it.  

- Drag-and-drop the reusable content item from the panel at the desired location in your document.

## Outline

When you select the **Outline** icon, you get the hierarchical view of the elements used in the document.

![](images/outline-view_cs.png){width="300" align="left"}

The Outline view offers the following features:

- A tree view of all elements used in the document.

- If an element has an ID, attribute, and text you can view them along with the element.

- Access Outline view in both Author and Source views.

- Use the filter drop-down list to show all elements or only the broken references:

- Choosing an element in the Outline view selects the element's content in the Author or Source view. The Outline view remains in sync with the Author and Source view. If you make any changes in any view, you can view them in the Outline view. For example, if you add a paragraph or update an element in the Author view, it is shown in the Outline view. 

    ![](images/select-element-content-outline-view_cs.png){width="650" align="left"}

- Drag and drop elements. You can easily replace an element by dropping another element on it. If you drag and drop an element over another element and you view a dashed rectangle box around the element, it indicates that the element will get replaced. It replaces the element on which the element is dropped.

    ![](images/replace-element-outline-view_cs.png){   align="left"}

    If you drag and drop an element, a dashed rectangle indicates that the element can be placed at the current location. If the drag and drop is invalid, then an error message is shown to indicate that the operation is not allowed.

    ![](images/drop-element-outline-view_cs.png){   align="left"}

- The **Options** menu in the *Outline* view allows you to perform generic operations such as Cut, Copy, Delete, Generate ID, Insert element before or after the current element, Rename or replace an element, Wrap an element, Unwrap an element, and create a snippet out of the selected element.

>[!NOTE]
>
>For more details on Generate ID, Insert element before or after the current element, and Unwrap an element, view [Other features in the Editor](web-editor-other-features.md#).

**View Configure**

Using the **View Configure** option, you can choose to view the following:

-  **Show ID**: Shows the id of the element.
-  **Show Attribute**: Shows the attribute along with its value.
-  **Show Text**: Shows the text. If the text is longer than 20 characters, then an ellipsis is displayed.

If a block element has its own text, it is displayed along with that block element. If it does not have it's own text, the text of the first child element is displayed along with that block element. 

![](images/outline-view-block-element.png){width="550" align="left"}

If your administrator has created a profile for attributes, then you'll get those attributes along with their configured values. You can also assign display attributes configured by your administrator under the **Display attributes** tab in the **Workspace settings** (appearing as **Settings** for **On-Prem**). The attributes defined for an element are displayed in the Layout and the Outline view.


**Search feature**

Using the search feature, you can search for an element by its name, id, text or attribute value. 

The search is case-insensitive and exactly matches the string. The search results are sorted on the basis of the element's position in the document. 
 
You can search for a string in the element if it is shown in the **Outline** view. For example, if the string "Adobe" is present in the text of the element and is shown in the Outline View panel (as you have selected **Show Text** from the View Options dropdown), then the containing element is filtered. But if the text is not shown in the Outline View panel (as you have not selected **Show Text** from the View Options dropdown), then the containing element is not filtered. Similarly, you will find the string in the ID or attributes if you have selected them.

## Glossary

Experience Manager Guides allows you to easily create and use the glossary type documents. You can create glossary topic files and then include them in a common glossary map. Once this map is added as your root map, the glossary entries are then shown in the Glossary panel.

![](images/glossary-panel.png){width="650" align="left"}

To insert a term from the glossary, simply drag-and-drop the entry from the panel to the desired location in your topic. The Options menu of a glossary term allows you to get a quick **Preview** of the entry term, **Copy path** of the entry term file, or locate the entry term file in the repository.

<details>
    <summary> Steps to search and replace text in glossary abbreviations </summary>

Perform the following steps to search text terms and replace them with glossary abbreviations:

1. Open the DITA topic or map in which you wish to search and convert the text or terms.
1. Select the glossary panel to view the glossary terms present in the root map. You can drag-and-drop these terms to add them to the open topic.
1. Select the **Hotspot** tool \( ![](images/hotspot-icon.svg)\) in the Glossary panel to search and convert specific text terms to linked glossary abbreviations. Also, vice versa you can use it to search glossary abbreviations and convert them to text terms.

</details>
    

You can configure the following settings of the Hotspot tool:

![](images/glossary-hotspot-tool.png){width="300" align="left"}


- **Glossary keys**: Select the glossary keys from the DITA map you want to use for the search in the selected topic. The selected keys will be displayed below. You can remove a selected key by selecting the **Remove** icon.

- **Topics**: Choose either the **Current topic** opened in the Editor, all **Opened topics** in the current map, or the **Current map** being edited in the Map Editor to search the terms.
- **Filter Topics by Status**: You can choose to limit the search to topics that have the selected document status. The topics can be in Draft, Edit, In-Review, Approved, Reviewed, Done status, or in any one of the state as configured by the organization.
- **Action**: You can choose to either search the glossary keys **Manually for each topic** or **Automatically for all topics**. If you choose **Manually for each topic**, it prompts you to confirm before converting each term in every topic. If you choose **Automatically for all topics**, it converts all terms in all the topics automatically.
- **Convert**: You can either convert a searched **Text to glossary term** or **Glossary term to text.**
- **Options**: You can select from the following options:
    - **Case-sensitive match**: Searches for a term to find the match which has the same casing. For example, 'USB' will not match with 'usb'.
    - **Convert only the first instance**: If multiple instances of the searched term are present in a topic, only the first instance is converted.
    - **Lock file before conversion**: The searched file is locked before the terms are converted.
    - **Create a new version after conversion**: A new version of the topic is created after the conversion of terms has been completed.
- **Next** button appears if you select **Manually for each topic** option. Select **Next** to convert the terms for each topic on the basis of the selected settings. It prompts for conversion of terms in each topic and moves to the next file. You can choose to convert a term or skip it and move to the next term.

    ![](images/manual-convert-skip.png){width="300" align="left"}

- **Convert** button appears if you select **Automatically for all topics** option. Select **Convert** to convert all the terms found in the document to linked glossary abbreviations.

A list of the **Topics Updated** with the converted terms and **Topics with Error** is displayed. Hover over the info icon near Topics with Error to view the details of the error.

>[!NOTE]
>
> Refresh the topic to view the converted terms.

## Conditions

The Conditions panel displays the conditional attributes defined by your administrator in the global or folder-level profile. You can add conditions to your content by simply dragging and dropping the desired condition onto your content. The conditional content is highlighted using the color defined for the condition for easy identification.

You can also apply multiple conditions on an element by dragging-and-dropping multiple conditions on an element. When you apply multiple conditions on an element, the Properties panel displays the applied conditions separated with a comma.

![](images/multiple-conditions-applied_cs.png){   align="left"}

However, in the Code view the conditions are separated using a space delimiter. When you add or edit a condition in Code view, ensure that multiple conditions are separated using a space.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
> The following screenshot is of a user with administrative privileges. As a user with administrative privileges, you can add, edit, and delete conditions. Else, as a normal author, you will only get the option to apply conditions.

![](images/conditional-content-through-panel_cs.png){   align="left"}

To add or define a condition, select the + icon next to Conditions panel to bring up the Define Condition dialog box:

![](images/conditional-panel-create-cond.png){width="400" align="left"}

From the Attribute list, select the conditional attribute that you want to define, enter a value for the condition, then specify the label that is displayed in the Conditions panel. Define a group for the condition. You can add multiple conditions to a group. You can also define a color for the condition. This color is set as the background color of the content on which the condition is applied.

You can group the conditions and structure them in nested folders. Groups help you create conditions at multiple levels and organize them better for use in the content. 

For example, you can create condition groups of products like *Acrobat* and *AEM Guides*. You can select the conditional attributes for both groups. Under each group, you can have specific values like *User*, *Admin*, *Reviewer*, and *Author*.  

>[!NOTE]
>
> Either type in to create a new group or select an existing group for a particular attribute.

You can use `/` and define sub-groups like `AEM Guides/Cloud Service`.



![condtions organised in a nested hierarchy](images/conditions-nested-hierarchy.png){width="300" align="left"}


To edit a condition, choose **Edit** from the Options menu. The Edit Condition dialog box is displayed:

![](images/conditional-panel-edit-cond.png){width="400" align="left"}

Specify the details in the same way as configured while defining a new condition.

## Subject scheme 

Subject scheme maps are a specialized form of DITA maps that are used to define taxonomic subjects and controlled values. Depending upon your requirements, you can create a subject scheme map and reference it within your root map file. Experience Manager Guides allows you to define the nested-level hierarchy of the subject definitions in your subject scheme.

You can easily create and then use the subject scheme in a subject scheme map. Once this map is added as your root map, the subject scheme is then shown in the Subject Scheme panel. The Subject scheme panel displays the available subject scheme in a nested or hierarchical manner.

Experience Manager Guides also supports nested level subject scheme maps, and you can have multiple subject schemes defined under the root subject scheme map.

<details>
    <summary> How to use subject scheme in Experience Manager Guides </summary>
The following example shows how to use subject scheme in Experience Manager Guides.

1. Create a subject scheme file in a tool of your choice. The following XML code creates subject scheme that binds values for the `platform` attribute.

    ```XML
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <!DOCTYPE subjectScheme PUBLIC "-//OASIS//DTD DITA Subject Scheme Map//EN" "subjectScheme.dtd">
    <subjectScheme id="GUID-4f942f63-9a20-4355-999f-eab7c6273270">
        <title>rw</title>
        <!-- Define new OS values that are merged with those in the unixOS scheme -->
        <subjectdef keys="os">
            <subjectdef keys="linux">    </subjectdef>
            <subjectdef keys="mswin">    </subjectdef>
            <subjectdef keys="zos">    </subjectdef>
        </subjectdef>
        <!-- Define application values -->
        <subjectdef keys="app" navtitle="Applications">
            <subjectdef keys="apacheserv">    </subjectdef>
            <subjectdef keys="mysql">    </subjectdef>
        </subjectdef>
        <!-- Define an enumeration of the platform attribute, equal to       each value in the OS subject. This makes the following values       valid for the platform attribute: linux, mswin, zos -->
        <enumerationdef>
            <attributedef name="platform">    </attributedef>
            <subjectdef keyref="os">    </subjectdef>
        </enumerationdef>
        <!-- Define an enumeration of the otherprops attribute, equal to       each value in the application subjects.       This makes the following values valid for the otherprops attribute:       apacheserv, mysql -->
        <enumerationdef>
            <attributedef name="otherprops">    </attributedef>
            <subjectdef keyref="app">    </subjectdef>
        </enumerationdef>
    </subjectScheme>
    ```

    ![](images/subject-scheme-panel-new.png){width="300" align="left"}

1. Save the file with a.ditamap extension and upload it to any folder in DAM.

    >[!NOTE]
    >
    > You can add a reference to the subject scheme file in the parent DITA map.

    ![](images/subject-scheme-root-map-new.png){width="550" align="left"}

1. Set the parent map as the root map in the **User preferences**. Once this map is added as your root map, the subject scheme is then shown in the Subject scheme panel.

    ![](images/subject-scheme-user-preferences-new.png){width="650" align="left"}
   

1. In the Editor, open the file where you want to use the subject scheme definitions.
1. Apply the subject scheme to your content by simply dragging and dropping the desired subject scheme onto your content. The content is then highlighted in the defined color.

<details>
    <summary> Handling hierarchical definitions of subject definitions and enumerations </summary>

  Besides handling the enumerations and the subject definitions present in the same map, Experience Manager Guides also provides the feature to define enumerations and subject definitions in two separate maps. You can define one or more subject definitions in a map and the enumeration definitions in another map and then add the map reference. For example, the following XML code creates subject definitions and enumeration definitions in two separate maps. 

   The subject definitions are defined in `subject_scheme_map_1.ditamap`   

 
```XML
  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> 
    <!DOCTYPE subjectScheme PUBLIC "-//OASIS//DTD DITA Subject Scheme Map//EN" "../dtd/libs/fmdita/dita_resources/DITA-1.3/dtd/subjectScheme/dtd/subjectScheme.dtd">

        <subjectdef keys="azure" navtitle="Microsoft Azure">
        </subjectdef>
        <subjectdef keys="gcp" navtitle="Google Cloud Platform">
        </subjectdef>
    </subjectdef>
    </subjectScheme>
```

The enumeration definition is present in    subject_scheme_map_2.ditamap. 

```XML
    ?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> 
        <!DOCTYPE subjectScheme PUBLIC "-//OASIS//DTD DITA Subject Scheme Map//EN" "../dtd/libs/fmdita/dita_resources/DITA-1.3/dtd/subjectScheme/dtd/subjectScheme.dtd"> 
        <subjectScheme id="subject-scheme.ditamap_17c433d9-0558-44d4-826e-3a3373a4c5ae"> 
        <title>subject_scheme_map_2</title> 
        <mapref format="ditamap" href="subject_scheme_map_1.ditamap" type="subjectScheme"> 
        </mapref> 
        <enumerationdef>
        <attributedef name="platform">
        </attributedef>
        <subjectdef keyref="mobile">
        </subjectdef>
        <subjectdef keyref="cloud">
        </subjectdef>
        </enumerationdef>
        </subjectScheme>
```

 Here subject definitions are defined in `subject_scheme_map_1.ditamap`  while the enumeration def is present in `subject_scheme_map_2.ditamap`. The reference to `subject_scheme_map_1.ditamap` is also added in `subject_scheme_map_2.ditamap`. 

>[!NOTE] 
>
> As the `subject_scheme_map_1.ditamap` and `subject_scheme_map_2.ditamap` are referenced with each other hence the subject schemes are getting resolved.  

The subject-enumeration references are resolved in the following order of priority: 

  1. Same map 
  1. Referenced map  

 
The references are not resolved if the enumeration is not found in the same map and the referenced map. 

</details>  

<details>
    <summary> Restrict the values to a specific element </summary>


You can also restrict the conditions to some elements within a topic. Use the `<elementdef>` tag to define the element and the `<attributedef>` tag to define the condition that can be applied to the element.  If you don't add the `<elementdef>` tag, you can apply the conditions to all elements. 
For example, use the following enumeration to restrict the `@platform` attribute to the `<shortdesc>` element.  The other conditions are visible for all elements.

```XML
<enumerationdef>
    <elementdef name="shortdesc">
    </elementdef>
    <attributedef name="platform">
    </attributedef>
    <subjectdef keyref="deliveryTargetValues">
    </subjectdef>
    <subjectdef keyref="os">
    </subjectdef>
  </enumerationdef>
```

</details>


**Attributes** drop-down

You can also change the value of the subject scheme using the **Attributes** dropdown from the **Content properties** panel in the **Author** view. 

Perform the following steps to change the value:

 1. Select an attribute from the **Attribute** dropdown. 
 1. Select **Edit**.
 1. Select the required value from the **Value** dropdown.
 1. Select **Update**.   

You can also apply values for an attribute by selecting multiple values from the dropdown.

**Source view**

You can also change the values from the attribute's drop-down in the Source view. The Source view also prevents you from adding any incorrect value.

![](images/subject-scheme-code-error.png){width="550" align="left"}

**View and apply the subject scheme from the Conditions panel**

You can also view and apply the subject scheme from the Conditions panel.

To view the subject scheme from the Conditions panel, your system administrator must select the **Show subject scheme in the Conditions panel** option under the General tab in **Workspace settings** (appearing as **Settings** for **On-Prem**). For more details, view the [Tab bar](./web-editor-tab-bar.md).

The Conditions panel displays the flat vertical structure of the subject definitions within the subject scheme.

You can add conditions to your content by dragging and dropping the desired condition onto your content. The conditional content is highlighted using the color defined for the condition.

## Snippets

Snippets are small content fragments that can be reused across various topics in your documentation project. The Snippets panel shows a collection of content snippets that you have created. To insert a snippet, drag-and-drop the snippet from the panel to the desired location in your topic. The Snippets panel allows you to add, edit, delete, preview, and insert a snippet.

>[!IMPORTANT]

    - **Path**: To search on the selected path
    - **Select Map**: To search in the selected map

1. You can use the **Options** dropdown and choose from the following options:

    - **Lock file before replace**: Select this option if you want to lock a file automatically before replacing the search term. This setting is more relevant in case your administrator has enabled the configuration to lock a file before editing. With the backend setting enabled, you should select this option. It will prevent the file lock dialog from prompting you to lock every file before making any change. If you do not select this option, then a prompt will appear before a file is opened for editing.
    - **Whole words only**: Select this option if you want to search for the whole search string. For example, if you enter over in the search string, then the search result will return all files containing words like over and overview. If you want to restrict your search to return the exact term that is entered, then select this option.
    - **Create new version after replace**: Select this option if you want to create a new version of the topic in which you choose to replace the text. You can also provide version comments which will be added with each updated file.

        If you don't select this option, then the changes are saved in the current version of the topic and no new version is created.

    - **Include indirect references**: Select this option if you want to search the string in the indirect references also within the DITA map. By default, this is disabled so the search is performed only on the direct references.

1. Select **Replace all** \( ![](images/replace-all-in-file-icon.svg)\)to replace all occurrences of the searched term in a single file with the replace term in a single click. You will be shown a notification after replacing all the occurrences in the selected file.

Only one replace all operation can be performed at a time in the whole system, and till the time operation is being performed you will view "Replace all in progress" status. You can also abort the replace all operation in between or view the log report. If you abort the operation, you will receive a notification about it in your Inbox.
