When a review task is marked as completed by a Reviewer, a notification is triggered to the task initiator, enabling them to access and review the task and related task level comments. 

As the initiator of the review task, you can then decide how to proceed based on the feedback. The available options are:

- Close the review task
- Request a re-review
