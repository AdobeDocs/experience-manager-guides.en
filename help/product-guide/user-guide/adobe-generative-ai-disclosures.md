# Adobe Generative AI user disclosures  

User Guidelines governing your access and use of Adobe Experience Manager Guides Generative AI features are found [here](https://www.adobe.com/legal/licenses-terms/adobe-gen-ai-user-guidelines.html).

In addition, please always use your judgment to evaluate generated output and any source attributions. Acrobat and Acrobat Reader generative AI features are built upon powerful, emerging large language model technologies that may generate outputs that are inaccurate or misleading, or otherwise reflect content that does not represent Adobe’s views. This is especially true if you try to use these features to generate outputs that are unrelated to your source document.  

**Do not use generative AI features to seek legal, medical, financial, or other kinds of professional advice or any opinions, judgments, or recommendations without conducting your own independent consultation or research. Generative AI features cannot replace advice provided by a qualified professional and do not form any such relationship (for example, an attorney-client relationship)**.

## Attributions

When the AI Assistant analyzes a document, it identifies sentences most likely to support the answer to your question. Attribution can take the form of clickable citations or other helpful cues indicating where generated information came from. However, because the AI Assistant is powered by generative AI models, and the technology is still evolving and not perfect, not all answers are helpful or accurate. As a result, the AI Assistant may not find and display answers to your questions — even when the information is in your document. And rarely, the AI Assistant may provide incorrect attributions. For example, you may receive a clickable citation or cue that takes you to an unrelated section instead of providing helpful information on where the answer came from in the document. Please double-check all AI-generated responses.

Please note that in our current version, if the language of the question and response is different than the language of your document, AI Assistant won't provide any attribution. In such scenarios, you can try asking questions in the language of the document to receive clickable citations in the response. 

## Feedback

We provide a feedback mechanism directly within the AI Assistant to help us improve accuracy and other performance issues. This is an ongoing process, and we will continue to work together with our customers and community to harness the power of this new technology responsibly.
