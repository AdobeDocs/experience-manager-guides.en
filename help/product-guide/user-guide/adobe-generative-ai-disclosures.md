# Adobe Experience Manager Guides Generative AI user disclosures  

User Guidelines governing your access and use of Experience Manager Guides AI Assistant are found [here](https://www.adobe.com/legal/licenses-terms/adobe-dx-gen-ai-user-guidelines.htmlS).

In addition, please always use your judgment to evaluate generated output and any source attributions. Experience Manager Guides generative AI features are built upon powerful, emerging large language model technologies that may generate outputs that are inaccurate or misleading, or otherwise reflect content that does not represent Adobe’s views.   

**Do not use generative AI features to seek legal, medical, financial, or other kinds of professional advice or any opinions, judgments, or recommendations without conducting your own independent consultation or research. Generative AI features cannot replace advice provided by a qualified professional and do not form any such relationship (for example, an attorney-client relationship)**.

## Attributions

AI Assistant is powered by generative AI models, and the technology is still evolving and not perfect, not all answers are helpful or accurate. As a result, the AI Assistant may not find and display answers to your questions — even when the information is in your content. And rarely, the AI Assistant may provide incorrect attributions. 

## Feedback

We provide a feedback mechanism directly within the AI Assistant to help us improve accuracy. This is an ongoing process, and we will continue to work together with our customers and community to harness the power of this new technology responsibly.
