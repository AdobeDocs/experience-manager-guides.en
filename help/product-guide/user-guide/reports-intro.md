In an organizational setup, you want to verify the overall completeness of your technical documentation before you start working on it or pushing the documents live. Such a need becomes even more essential in multi-user and large scale environments. AEM Guides provides a few reports that give a useful insight into the overall health of the content in your repository and how content is being used in the documentation process.

You can create DITA map reports in two ways:

-   **From the Web Editor**: Allows you to generate the topic list and the metadata report for the current DITA map from the Web Editor. You can sort the topics or filter them based on your selection. You also have the feature to bulk update the metadata of the selected topics.
-   **From the map dashboard**: Allows you to generate the DITA map report and provides the detailed information both at map-level and topic-level.
