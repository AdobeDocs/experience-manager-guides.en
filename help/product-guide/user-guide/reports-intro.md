# Introduction to reports {#id1645H9007MZ}

In an organizational setup, you want to verify the overall completeness of your technical documentation before you start working on it or pushing the documents live. Such a need becomes even more essential in multi-user and large scale environments. Adobe Experience Manager Guides provides a few reports that give a useful insight into the overall health of the content in your repository and how content is being used in the documentation process.

You can access DITA map reports in two ways:

-   **From the Map console**: Allows you to generate topic list, manage the metadata of all references, view the multimedia list and fix all the broken links for the current DITA map from the Map console. You can sort the topics or filter them based on your selection. You also have the feature to bulk update the metadata of the selected topics. All the reports are paginated. You can simply scroll down and the new set of records keep loading.

-   **From the Map dashboard**: Allows you to generate the DITA map report and provides the detailed information both at map-level and topic-level.
