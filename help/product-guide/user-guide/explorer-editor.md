# Search panel

The Search panel in the Editor is a feature that enhances productivity by allowing quick access to relevant files and references while editing content. It helps streamline your workflow by enabling you to search, filter, and insert references without leaving the Editor interface. 

You can locate the Search panel at the bottom of the Editor. It can be accessed either by clicking the Search icon at the top of the Explorer panel or through the Show in Search panel option when navigating from the Repository view on the Home interface.

## Key Benefits

- Centralized view of all search results for easy reference.
- Drag-and-drop functionality to insert references directly into your current topic.
- Flexible options to modify or refine searches without leaving the Editor.

## Search from the Explorer panel

When working in the Editor interface and you need to find relevant files:

1. Select the **Search** icon located at the top-right corner of the Explorer panel.
    This opens the **Search repository** dialog, which offers the same search and filtering experience as the Repository view on the Home page.

2. Perform your search and apply filters as needed. For detailed instructions on search and filter options, view [Search and filtering experience](./home-repository-view.md#search-and-filtering-experience).
3. Once your search is complete, select **Show in Search panel**. Your recent searches will then appear in the Search panel at the bottom of the Editor.

4. Use the **Modify search** option on the Search panel to refine your results further.

## Search from the Repository view 

When you perform a search and apply filters on the Home page:

- You can mirror these results in the Search panel by selecting Show in Search panel.
- From here, you can easily drag and drop topics from the Search panel into your current topic in the Editor to attach references.
