## AI Assistant overview

The **AI Assistant** in Adobe Experience Manager Guides is a powerful, AI-driven tool designed to enhance your productivity through smart help and authoring features. It brings together two robust AI features — **Authoring** and **Help** — into the Experience Manager Guides interface, enabling you to author content and access information from Experience Manager Guides documentation faster and more efficiently. 

>[!NOTE]

> The AI Assistant feature is currently available for Adobe Experience Manager Guides as a Cloud Service. 

The **Authoring** feature in AI Assistant makes your authoring process smarter and faster. It offers capabilities such as generating intelligent suggestions for content reuse, translating content, improving content quality, and more, all based on your selected content. This feature enhances the overall authoring experience and the productivity of authors.

The **Help** feature in AI Assistant is an intuitive, chat-based tool designed to help you better understand Experience Manager Guides, troubleshoot issues, and search through information within Adobe Experience Manager Guides Documentation. Instead of searching through user guides and reference documents, you can use the **Help** feature to quickly find relevant answers to your queries. This helps save time and allows you to focus on content creation, resulting in enhanced productivity and efficiency.
