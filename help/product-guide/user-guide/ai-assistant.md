The **Help** feature in AI Assistant is an intuitive, chat-based tool designed to help you better understand Experience Manager Guides, troubleshoot issues, and search through information within Adobe Experience Manager Guides Documentation. Instead of searching through user guides and reference documents, you can use the **Help** feature to quickly find relevant answers to your queries. This helps save time and allows you to focus on content creation, resulting in enhanced productivity and efficiency.
