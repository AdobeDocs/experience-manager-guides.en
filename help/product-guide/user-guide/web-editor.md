# Work with the Web Editor {#id181OD0QE05Z}

AEM Guides comes with an easy-to-use web-based Web Editor for creating and editing structured documents. The editor hides all the complexities of the DITA structure from the writer. The editor provides a list of DITA elements that a user would usually need to work within a document.

Also, the Web Editor is DITA-aware and it supports DITA 1.3, 1.2 standards, lightweight DITA, and also specialized DITA. This implies that it will not allow you to place elements at locations that are not in accordance with the DITA standards. The Web Editor also allows you to work with the most commonly used block and in-line elements.
