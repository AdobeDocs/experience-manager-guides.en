# Key AEM Guides features {#id167G9I060SI}

**Powerful DITA authoring and content management**
Significantly improve authoring productivity through single-sourcing of modular information optimized for effective reuse at a granular level \(modules, components, words, graphics, multimedia, and translations\).

The built-in web-based editor helps you easily author and effectively manage DITA topics, maps, and DITAVAL files. The built-in editor has a simple and intuitive word-processing interface, which provides an easy entry for subject matter experts, casual contributors, and reviewers who might not be trained to use DITA. With the intelligent Insert Element functionality, you don't have to worry about placing an element at the correct location. An element is always inserted at the next available valid location.

You can also check-out and check-in files from the new options made available in AEM toolbar and web editor.

If your organization uses a specialized form of DITA, the web editor can be customized to create and edit specialized DITA documents. For more details about using DITA specialization, see *Use custom DITA-OT and DITA specialization* in Install and configure Adobe Experience Manager Guides as a Cloud Service.

Currently, the built-in editor supports the following DITA standards:

* DITA 1.2
* DITA 1.3
* Lightweight DITA


>[!NOTE]

> Lightweight DITA is still under the proposal state and has not yet become a DITA standard.

**Next-gen collaboration through web-based review**
Ensure that multi-author, multi-reviewer distributed teams collaborate smoothly through powerful web-based composite review workflow, minimizing the scope of manual errors in the process.

AEM Guides provides powerful yet easy-to-use web-based review capabilities. You can send multiple DITA topics for review simultaneously. The reviewing capability helps ensure that the document content is reviewed efficiently. Authors and reviewers can effortlessly collaborate on changes during ongoing reviews. Reviewers can monitor the differences from previous versions to identify if feedback has been incorporated correctly. Administrators can track the review task history using the feature-rich management dashboard.

Every document in your DAM now gets a document status. This document status helps you identify what state in the documentation process the document is. You as an administrator of the system can define the document states, default start and end states, and document state transition for your documents.

**Industry-leading translation management and localization support**
Get significant savings on translation time and costs, and ensure that published content is free of translation errors.

Adobe Experience Manager comes with built-in connectors for leading translation providers. Leverage these connectors to manage locale-specific content. Make full use of the detailed out-of-the-box translation reports to identify untranslated content before publishing and take appropriate corrective actions. You can manage the status of translated content with respect to master language updates to carry out translation only for the updated DITA files. Time-consuming, manual identification of files to send for translation is not required.

**Best-in-class multichannel publishing of DITA content**
Streamline enterprise content publishing with a seamless, one-touch approach that accelerates time to market.

With the native DITA support added to Experience Manager, generate output for Experience Manager Sites, PDF, HTML5, EPUBS, or custom output through DITA-OT. You can leverage the fully configurable output to deliver highly personalized, relevant, and immersive content experiences for end users. You can also easily perform batch generation or use Baseline to publish a specific version of your documentation.

**Comprehensive search and content usage data**
Find and select relevant content faster, maximizing the ROI on content with every reuse. Perform basic and advanced searches using content attributes and topic metadata across the entire repository through a simple interface inside the DITA authoring tool. Results are tagged with content usage data to help you easily identify and select the right content for optimal reuse.

**In-depth publishing readiness reports**
Make publishing error-free by easily checking and correcting content before it goes live. Keep a close watch on system health by easily accessing various reports at the DITA map level. You can check the number of missing topics, broken links or references, and the status of reviews, and translations for all topics. You can also use the reports to perform comprehensive sanity checks in the final stages before publishing.

**Extensive tag management support for personalized output**   
Drive deeper end-user engagement and content adoption through highly relevant content experiences. With AEM Guides, you can leverage the extensive tag management support in Experience Manager to apply relevant tags on DITA source content. Use these tags to provide highly personalized content experiences to end users.

**Native integration with Adobe FrameMaker**
Enjoy a fast and seamless experience while working with Experience Manager and FrameMaker (2015 release) Update 4 or later.

The tight integration of Experience Manager and FrameMaker through a built-in connector helps you work seamlessly with the Experience Manager content repository. Leverage the connector to quickly get started with authoring, reviewing, and searching DITA content.

Using the AEM connector in FrameMaker, you can manage your FrameMaker files. The AEM connector allows you to easily upload your DITA and other FrameMaker documents (.book and .fm) on AEM. AEM Guides also allows you to publish FrameMaker documents directly from AEM. In case your FrameMaker book file contains a combination of DITA and .fm files, AEM Guides can publish such documents as well. Currently, you can publish FrameMaker's .book and .fm files into PDF, HTML5, and EPUB formats.
