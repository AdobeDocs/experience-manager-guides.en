## Features available in Map console:

The following features are available when you [open a DITA map file in Map console](./open-files-map-console.md):

**Output generation**

With Map console, you can efficiently generate outputs in various formats, including AEM Sites, PDF, HTML5, EPUB, JSON, and custom output through DITA-OT, Native PDF publishing, and FMPS. You can generate output for an entire DITA map or you can selectively publish only a few topics that you have updated. You can also use the Baseline publishing feature to selectively publish a specific version of your DITA map or topic.

For more details, view [Output generation](./generate-output.md).

**Report creation and management**

In an organizational setup, you want to verify the overall completeness of your technical documentation before you start working on it or pushing the documents live. Such a need becomes even more essential in multi-user and large-scale environments. With Map console, you get access to Experience Manager Guides reports that give a useful insight into the overall health of the content in your repository and how content is being used in the documentation process.

For example, you can add attributes as version 1.0 and version 2.0 in your content, and use a condition preset to include version 1.0 for release 1.0 and exclude version 2.0. Similarly, you can add attributes as OS Windows and OS Linux to your content, and then include or exclude the relevant content for your final output according to the operating system.
