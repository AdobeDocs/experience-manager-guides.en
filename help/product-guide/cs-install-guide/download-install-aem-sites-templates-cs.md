>Once you have created the home page, you can use this path as the **Publish Path** for generating the output of your AEM Sites presets. For example, `aemg-docs-en/docs/product-abc`.


## Configure the templates to use with the AEM Sites presets

Once the package is installed, a site named **AEMG** is created in the Sites UI. This sample site shows how you can set up the site structure for generating AEM Sites output. This is just a recommendation, and you can create custom sites per your requirements.

 **AEMG Sites contains the following components. 
- A folder for English(en) language is present in the **AEMG** folder. You can create similar language copies as per your requirements. For example, a multilingual website includes English (en), German (de), and French(fr) language copies.  Learn more about how to create a language copy using the [Language Copy Wizard](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-manager-65/content/sites/administering/introduction/tc-wizard).
- Within the English(en) language folder, Experience Manager Guides provides many out-of-the-box sample pages like **Search**, **Sign in**, **Docs**, and **Support**. 

- A sample page **Product1** is present under **Docs**, which is the Documentation Home Page. The Documentation Home Page serves as a central location for all product-related documentation. It displays each product for which documentation is available as individual tiles. You can have home pages for individual products such as Product1.
- Along with the Documentation Home Page, there are sample pages for **Search**, **Sign in**, and **Support**. You can customize these samples as per your requirements and create AEM Sites pages for your products.   
- Experience Manager Guides also provides the following predefined templates: 

    - **Content Page**: These are the standard pages that contain most of the product site's content. They can include text, images, videos, and other content elements. For example, any marketing article that showcases a specific product feature and includes promotional content.
    - **Home Page**: The main landing page of a website, which includes an overview, key sections like the key elements and features, and navigation links. For example, the main page of a product ABC connects to the other content or feature pages.
    - **Topic Page**: The pages used for organizing and presenting topic-based content. For example, a user guide contains different topic pages, each of which contains a specific topic related to features, use cases, and troubleshooting.

Use these samples and templates to generate your AEM Sites outputs:
- A product home page corresponds to a map home page and is created using the Home Page template. Select this path in the AEM Sites preset to publish the mapâ€™s contents under it. The product home page can include other home pages. 
- For example, you have a product like Experience Manager Guides and need three manuals for users, administrators, and developers.  Create a home page for each manual using the Home Page template and then select the corresponding home page in the AEM Sites output preset.

## Create a home page using the template

Perform the following steps to create the home page for your product:  
1. Once the package is installed, select **Sites** from the Global Navigation.
1. Select the "AEMG Docs" template installed in the Sites UI.
1. Within the Sites UI, click the **Create** button on the top-right corner.
1. Select **Page** from the **Create** dropdown.
1. Select **Home Page** and then click **Next**. 
1. Enter the Site title and the Site name and click **Create** on the top-right corner. An AEM site template is created using the **Home Page** site template. For example, you can create a home page for your product `Product ABC`.

Perform the following steps to edit the topic templates:
1. Select the template that you wish to edit. 
1. Select the **Edit** icon on the top.

## Customize existing AEM Sites templates 

Besides the predefined templates, you can also use your existing templates with the AEM Sites presets based on core components mapping. Perform the following steps to customize existing AEM Sites templates:

### Template Setup

You need the following two types of templates:

- Category or Landing Template: This is used for the Product documentation landing page and corresponds to a DITA map.  AEM Site Page for a DITA map is generated using this template. You can use this at any level.
        - Add a text component to your existing template. The text component should have a mandatory property, `text="$category.html$"`.
        - For example, you can pick we-retail templates and use the section-page template as the landing page template for the DITA map. To do so, make the changes as shown in the following screenshot:
![section page template](assets/customize-existing-aem-templates-section.png)
    -  Detail Page or Topic Page Template: Use this template for the content of topics of a map. All the Sites pages of DITA/XML content are created using Topic Page templates. To create these templates, there are two pre-requisites:
        - Add a text component to the template, contained in a container component, with a mandatory property. `text="$topic.content$"`. 
![container page template](assets/customize-existing-aem-templates-container.png)
       - Reflect the same container and text component in the structure of the same template, as shown in the following screenshot:
![structure of container template](assets/customize-existing-aem-templates-structure.png)

### Tag Category Page as documentation container

Assuming a site hierarchy is created for the documentation pages using the previous template, choose one of the category pages created in that site hierarchy. Tag the category page as a Documentation container by giving it an ID. 
To do so, assign its property `id` a value `category-page`. Refer to the following screenshot:
