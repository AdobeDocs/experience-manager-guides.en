The Web editor provides a powerful translation feature to translate your content into multiple languages.

1.  Log into **Adobe Experience Manager** as an administrator.
1.  Click on the **Adobe Experience Manager** link at the top and choose **Tools**.
1.  Select **Guides** from the list of tools and click the **Folder Profiles**.
1.  Click on the **Global Profile** tile.
1.  Click on **XML Editor Configuration**.
1.  Click on **Edit** icon on the top.
1.  Download the `ui\_config.json` file.Remove the following code snippet from the downloaded file:

    ```json
    {
        "component":"tab",
        "id":"workflow",
        "title":"Manage",
        "on-click":"APP_MODE_CHANGE",
        "items":
        [
            {
                "component":"label",
                "label":"Manage"
            }
        ]
    },
    ```

1.  Upload the updated ui\_config.json file.

Note that the **Manage** filter is no longer available.
