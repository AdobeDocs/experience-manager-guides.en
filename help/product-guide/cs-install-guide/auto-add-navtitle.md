# Include @navtitle attribute by default {#id2115BC0J0XA}

You can add different types of reference files in a map, for example topic, reference, task, \(sub\) maps, and so on. Most of these files support the `@navtitle` attribute. However, not many authors use it consistently. If you want to enforce usage of the `@navtitle` attribute in all referenced files in a map, then you can do so with a simple configuration.

Once enabled, every reference file that you add in a map will automatically get the `@navtitle` attribute added to its properties. The `@navtitle` will also get the value of the `title` element of the referenced content.

To include `@navtitle` attribute by default in reference files' properties, perform the following steps:

1.  To download the UI configuration file log into Adobe Experience Manager as an administrator.

1.  Click on the Adobe Experience Manager link at the top and choose **Tools**.
1.  Select **Guides** from the list of tools and click the **Folder Profiles**.
1.  Click on the **Global Profile** tile.
1.  Select the **XML Editor Configuration** tab and click **Edit** icon on the top
1.  Click the **Download** icon to download the ui\_config.json file on your local system.
1.  You can make this change at the Global level or at a folder level profile. Depending on where you want to make this change, you need to download the respective ui\_config.json file. For more information about downloading ui\_config.json file, see [Configure and customize the XML Web Editor](conf-folder-level.md#id2065G300O5Z).

1.  Search for the `ditaAttributes` definition.

    The default definition of `ditaAttributes` is:

    ```
    "ditaAttributes": {
                            "attributes": [],
                            "constraint": false,
                            "required": {}
                            },
    ```

1.  Change the `required` parameter as:

    ```
    "required": {"navtitle": true}
    ```

1. Save the file.

1. Upload the file in the corresponding profile \(Global or Folder\).


With this configuration, every reference file that you add to a map will contain the `@navtitle` attribute by default.
