# Disclaimer

Starting with the 2502 release, Experience Manager Guides features a new UI and an updated User Guide to enhance usability and streamline workflows. If you're using the latest version, refer to the [New User Guide](../product-guide/overview.md) for the most up-to-date information.

If you are using a previous version of Experience Manager Guides, the legacy documentation remains available to support your ongoing needs. You can continue to access the [Old User Guide](overview.md) for detailed information on previous UI workflows and features.
