# Translate content {#id1645H700L67}

AEM Guides comes with powerful capabilities that enable you to translate your content into multiple languages. Both, human and machine translation workflows are supported by AEM Guides.

-   **Human translation** - Assets are sent to your translation provider and translated by professional translators. When complete, the translated assets are returned and they are then imported back into AEM.

-   **Machine translation** - This is the default service in AEM wherein the content is immediately translates using the machine translation in real time. Out-of-the-box AEM provides the capability to connect to Microsoft Translator.
