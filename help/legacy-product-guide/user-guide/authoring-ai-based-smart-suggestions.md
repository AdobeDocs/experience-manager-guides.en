# AI-powered Smart Suggestions to author content

Experience Manager Guides provides the **Smart Suggestions** feature that helps you create consistent and accurate content.  

While you author content, the **Smart Suggestions** feature can search using AI and show the existing content that is semantically similar to your content. You can then choose the best matching content you want to include in your current topic as a reference.

This helps you reuse existing content from your documentation repository and create consistent content. For example, you are making a document containing information about **Adobe Firefly**, including a paragraph about **Adobe**. In that case, you can quickly view and add the content reference from another topic, like **Adobe Photoshop**, which includes the same paragraph.





When you open a topic in the Web Editor, the **Smart Suggestions** panel appears on the right.

> Your administrator must configure the **Smart Suggestions** feature. For more details, view the [Configure the AI-powered smart suggestions for authoring](/help/product-guide/cs-install-guide/conf-smart-suggestions.md) section in the Installation and Configuration Guide for Cloud Services.
