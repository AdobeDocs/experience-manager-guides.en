# Configure a data source connector from the user interface

Experience Manager Guides comes with the **Data Sources** tool that helps you configure out-of-the-box connectors for data sources. You can set up the JIRA, SQL (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, SQLite, MariaDB, H2DB), AdobeCommerce, ElasticSearch, and Generic REST Client connectors.

To configure a connector, perform the following steps:

1. Select the **Adobe Experience Manager** link at the top and choose Tools. 
1. Select **Guides** from the list of tools.
1. Select the **Data Sources** tile. The **Data Sources** page is displayed. You can view the connected data sources.

    You can toggle between the **List View** or **Tile View** to view the various connected data sources as a list or as tiles.

1. Click **Create**.

    >[!NOTE]

    >All the available out-of-the-box databases are listed.

    * **Username**: Enter your username.
    * **Password**: Enter your username and password. 
    * **URL**: Add the API URL.

1. Select **Test connection**. You can view the **Test Connection** button enabled only after you add the required details. View a success message if the connection details are correct. Otherwise, you might view an error message. 

    

1. Select **Save** on the top to save the connector.     View the **Save** button enabled after you fill in all the details and the connection is successful.


    If the connector is saved successfully, you can view the connected data source on the page. 

## Features available for a connector

* Toggle between the **List View** or **Tile View**  to view the various connected data sources as a list or as tiles. 
* Select the checkbox for a single connector. Click **Select All** to select all connectors. You can click **Deselect All** when all the connectors are selected.

*Edit, reconnect, duplicated, or delete a data source connector.*

You can use the following features for the connector on the **Data Sources** page:

* **Edit**: Edit the configuration details for the selected connector.

* **Reconnect**: Reconnect to a disconnected connector.

* **Duplicate**: Create a new duplicate connector using the current connector as the base. The duplicate connector is created with a suffix (like connectorname_1) by default. For example, sample-elastic-search_1. 
You view an error if the connector with the same name exists.

* **Delete**: Delete the selected connector.


Once you have configured the data source, the connector is listed under the **Data Sources panel** in the Web Editor. You can then connect to the data source and insert a content snippet into your topics. For more details, view [Insert a content snippet from your data source](../user-guide/web-editor-content-snippet.md).
