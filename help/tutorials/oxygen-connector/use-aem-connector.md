# Oxygen Plugin for Adobe Experience Manager Guides {#id1645H6010Q5}

The Oxygen Plugin for Adobe Experience Manager Guides \(later referred to as Oxygen Plugin for AEM Guides in the guide\) enables you to connect the Oxygen XML Author with the Adobe Experience Manager \(AEM\) repository for authoring and managing content. You can use the plugin to browse, search and open files; check-out and check-in files; upload folders and files on AEM repository. The AEM Guides panel in the desktop application allows you to mark the desired folders \(from AEM repository\) to the favorite folders list for quick access. Additionally, you can install a package in AEM web interface and open your DITA files in Oxygen XML Author directly from the AEM web interface.

## Download and install {#id1826M0L0PUI}

### Context menu Functions 

The functions of the Oxygen Plugin for AEM Guides are available on right-clicking a folder or file in the AEM repository. The functions available for the folders are different from the files. Here is a complete list of functions in Oxygen Plugin for AEM Guides context menu:

-   **Open**: Opens the selected file or expands the selected folder.
-   **Open In**: You can choose to open the selected file in AEM Guides' Web Editor or Map Dashboard, or Map Editor. For more information about these options, see [Open file in AEM Guides' editor](#id195GH0V30KX).
-   **Check-out**: Checks out a file from AEM repository. For more details, see [Check-out files](#id195HC020TS4).
-   **Check-out with dependents**: Checks out a file with its direct references. For more details, see [Check-out files](#id195HC020TS4).
-   **Check-out with read-only dependents**: Checks out the selected file along with its dependents. You cannot make any changes in the dependent files. For more details, see [Check-out files](#id195HC020TS4).
-   **Cancel check-out**: Cancels the checked-out file, closes the file from the editor, and reverts the changes to the last version of the file saved on the server.
-   **Refresh**: In case of a file, fetches the latest copy of the file from the AEM repository. For a folder, it fetches the folder structure and file's status. This means that is a file is added, then it will be shown in the AEM Guides View. Also, if a file is checked out on AEM server, doing a Refresh in Oxygen Author will show the file as checked out. However, this does not update the files list in the *Files Checked-Out in AEM Guides* View.
-   **Refresh Checked-out Files**: Refreshes the list of checked out files in the *Files Checked-Out in AEM Guides* View. If a file is checked out on AEM server, then doing a Refresh will update the list of checked out files in the *Files Checked-Out in AEM Guides* View.

If you have selected the **Auto-Checkout File when Opened** option \(in the Preferences dialog\), then on opening a file, the file is automatically checked out and is available for editing. To open a file, you can either double-click on a file name or right-click on the file name and choose **Open** from the context menu. If this option is not selected, then the file is opened in read-only mode.

>[!NOTE]
>
>You can also double-click on a file to open it.

### Open file in AEM Guides' editor {#id195GH0V30KX}

If you want to use the editors available in AEM Guides, you can do so by selecting the required option from the context menu. Perform the following steps to use AEM Guides' editor in place of Oxygen XML Author's editor:

1.  Right-click on a file in the AEM Guides panel that you want to open for editing.

1.  Select **Open In** from the context menu and choose from the following options:

    - **Web Topic Editor**: If the file you are opening is a .xml or .dita file, then you can open it for editing in the Web Editor. Choose the **Web Topic Editor** option to open the selected file for editing in the Web Editor.

    - **Map Dashboard**: You can choose to edit a .ditamap file in the map dashboard wherein you can perform various operations on the map file. These operations depend on the role/group that you belong to.

    - **Web DITA Map Editor**: If you want to open the .ditamap file for editing in the Map Editor, then choose this option. Using the DITA Map Editor option, you can add or remove topics, add relationship tables, and perform other operations on your map.


### Check-out files {#id195HC020TS4}

When you check out a file, it is stored locally on your system and locked for editing in the AEM repository. Perform the following steps to checkout a file:

1. You can check out your files in one of the following ways:
    - Right-click a file in the AEM Guides panel.
    - Right-click the map tab in the DITA Maps Manager panel.
    - Right-click a file in the DITA Maps Manager panel. 
    - Right-click the file tab when you open a map or topic in the Editor.
 
1. Select one of the following options:
   -  **Check-out:** Checks out a file from AEM repository and makes it available for editing.
   -  **Check-out with dependents**: Checks out a file with its direct references. You can make changes in parent and child pages using this option. Oxygen Plugin for AEM Guides supports checking out one level of dependents. For example, Map A references Topic A and Topic A references Topic B. Checking out Map A will checkout Topic A regardless of its level in the TOC hierarchy. However, it will not check out Topic B because it is not directly linked from Map A.
   -  **Check-out with read-only dependents**: Checks out a file and downloads its dependents to your local machine as read-only copies. You cannot make any changes in the dependent files.

If you have selected the **Open Files on Checkout** option \(in the Preferences dialog\), then on checking out a file, the file is automatically opened for editing.

If you have selected the **Auto-Checkout File when Opened** option \(in the Preferences dialog\), then on opening the file, the file is automatically checked out and is made available for editing. To open a file, you can either double-click on a file name or right-click on the file name and choose **Open** from the context menu.

When a file is checked-out, the icon of the file changes to show its locked status.

![Check out a file](images/check-out-file.png){width="650" align="left"}

In the above screenshot, a file checked out by other user is shown with a black colored lock icon \(A\). File checked out by the current user is shown with a green colored lock \(B\).

>[!NOTE]
>
>If the checked-out file is deleted or moved to any other folder in AEM, you get an error message when you check-in the file. Make sure that the checked-out file is not moved or deleted using the AEM web interface.

### Check in a file {#id182CF0J0FHS}

When you check in a file, the local copy from your system is stored in the AEM repository, and the lock on the file is removed. Perform the following steps to check in a file:

1. Save your file by clicking **File** \> **Save**.

1. Right-click on a checked-out file or map in one of the following locations:
    - AEM Guides panel
    - DITA Maps Manager panel 
    - The file tab when you open a map or topic in the Editor.
    - The map tab in the DITA Maps Manager panel.

1. Choose from the following two options:

   -  **Check-In**: Checks-in the selected file from your local system into AEM repository.
   -  **Check-In with Dependents:** If you have checked-out a file along with its dependents, then use this option to check in all dependent files in one single operation. On selecting this option, you are shown the Check-In dialog with all dependent files. Click OK to check-in all files at once.

     If you have not checked out dependent files and then you choose this option, then only those dependent files that you have \(separately\) checked out will be checked in. You will be shown a list of files that could not be checked in:

     ![check in errors](images/check-in-error.png){width="800" align="left"}

     It is strongly recommended not to move a file that is checked out. However, if a checked out file is moved to a different location, then you must cancel the checkout on that file. If you want to make updates on that file, then check out the file again, make changes, and then check it back in. If you try to check in a file that has been moved from its original location, then you will get an error.

     If a dependent file is checked out in AEM, then Check-In with Dependents will not show the dependent file in the Check-In dialog. To get a list of dependent files that are checked out in AEM, you must do a folder Refresh.

     Similarly, if you have checked-in a dependent file through AEM, the file list is not refreshed in Oxygen Author until you do a folder Refresh and Refresh Checked-Out Files. If you do a Check-in with Dependents with some files checked in through AEM, then you will get an error listing the files that could not be checked in.

1. \(Optional\) In the **Check-In** or the **Check-in with Dependents** dialog, add a comment in **Version Comments** text box.

    >[!NOTE]
    >
    >This comment is displayed in the AEM version history of the file.
   
1. Add label(s) in the **Label** text box in the **Check-In** or the **Check-in with Dependents** dialog . Enter a label and press Enter. For example, *2307 Release*.

    If your administrator has predefined a list of labels and uploaded them in the `label.json` file, then those labels are displayed as a dropdown. You can choose one or more labels from the dropdown.

    ![Check in dialog](images/checkin-dropdown-labels.png){width="550" align="left"}

    You can add multiple labels (separated by commas) to the same version of a topic.  For example, *Adobe*, *AEM*,*Guides*
    However, you cannot add the same label to the different versions of a topic. If you add a label that you have already added to a earlier version, it is added to the latest version and removed from the earlier version.

    >[!NOTE]
    > 
    > These labels are displayed in the AEM version history of the file.
   

1. Click **OK**.

>[!NOTE]

>If the checked-out file is deleted or moved to any other folder in AEM, you get an error message when you check-in the file. Make sure that the checked-out file is not moved or deleted using the AEM web interface.

### Files Checked-Out in AEM Guides View 

When you have in multiple folders, then it is not easy to find out how many files are checked out in one view. AEM Guides provides Files Checked-Out in AEM Guides View that gives one complete snapshot of currently checked-out files. Using this view, you can easily find out which files have been checked by you in AEM repository using AEM Guides. Perform the following steps to access and work with this view:

1. Click **Window** \> **Show View** \> **Files Checked-Out in AEM Guides**.

    The Files Checked-Out in AEM Guides view is displayed.

    ![checked out files](images/files-checkedout-view.png){width="550" align="left"}

1.  Right-click on a file in this view to get the following options:

    -   [Open](#id195GH0V30KX)
    -   [Open In](#id195GH0V30KX)
    -   Cancel Check-Out
    -   [Check-In](#id182CF0J0FHS)
    -   [Check-In with Dependents](#id182CF0J0FHS)
    -   [View Metadata](#id195GHN0H05C)
    -   [View Versions](#id195GI000D5Q)

**Notes on Files Checked-Out in AEM Guides View:**

-   The *Files Checked-Out in AEM Guides* View maintains user's sessions. This means that files checked out by the current user are stored and maintained in the view across the same user's sessions \(or cache\).

-   If the user changes the login credentials or the AEM server, then the checked-out file's data \(or cache\) in the view is reset. The user must manually run a *Refresh Checked-Out Files* command on each folder from where the files were earlier checked out. To simplify this, it is recommended to add your working folders to *Favorites* from where you can quickly do a folder refresh.

-   You can sort the files list on the basis of their File names, Title, or Path. If a new file is checked out, the file appears in sorted order in the view.


### Upload files and folders {#id195HC03F03J}

Perform the following steps to upload files or folders:

1.  Right-click a folder in the AEM Guides panel.
1.  Select one of the following options:
    -   **Upload File\(s\)**: Select this option to upload single or multiple files to the selected folder in the AEM repository. In the Select files \(s\) to upload dialog, select the files and click **Open**.
    -   **Upload with dependents**: Select this option to upload a DITA file with its dependents. In the Select file to upload dialog, select the files and click **Open**.
    -   **Upload Folder**: Select this option to upload a folder in the AEM repository. In the Choose dialog, select the folder and click **Choose**.

**Additional notes on working with UUID-based files**:

The following points must be considered while moving or copying content from your local system to AEM repository:

-   When uploading one or more files, a new UUID is generated for files not having any UUID. This UUID is added in the `topic id` of a DITA file.

-   When copying a folder, the references to the files \(within the folder\) are automatically updated in all DITA maps referencing files in that folder.

-   When copying a DITA map file, the UUID references within the map file are not changed.

-   If a file or a folder has a conflict or has a duplicate, then a unique filename is generated for the new file being copied or moved.

-   No two files can have the same UUID. A unique UUID is assigned to all new files.

-   If in case a file is being uploaded by two different users at the same time, then the file that is processed later overwrites the earlier file. However, such a practice should be avoided.

-   When you checkout content from AEM repository and make changes on your local system, ensure that file name is not changed at the time of uploading the file.

- When you insert a reference in the DITA Maps Manager, it displays the title of the file and not the UUID. If the title isn't present, then it displays the filename.

### Add or remove Favorites {#id195HC04405P}

## Work with attribute profiles {#id1827JA002YK}

AEM Guides allows you to easily create and associate conditional attributes using the relevant DITA attributes. You can define conditional attributes at the global level or folder level. The globally defined conditions are visible across all projects and folder level conditions are visible only in projects created within the specified folder. Content authors can use these conditional attributes to conditionalize content in their DITA topics or maps that they create or use. To know more about how to create conditional attributes in AEM using the AEM Guides, see *Configure conditional attributes for global or folder-level profiles* section in Install and configure Adobe Experience Manager Guides.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Make sure that you have added the conditional attributes in AEM and have set [Preference for profiling attribute customization](#id1827K0D0OHT) before you add conditional attributes to your content.

Perform the following steps to add conditional attributes to your content in Oxygen XML Author:

1.  Check-out and open a topic from the *Oxygen Plugin for AEM Guides*.
1.  Select the part of the content where you want to apply the conditional attributes.
1.  Double-click the conditional attribute in the Attributes panel of the Oxygen XML Author.

    ![attributes panel](images/attribute-panel.png){width="300" align="left"}

## Troubleshooting common issues {#id188ABC00RY4}

This topic covers some of the most common issues that you might face while working with the Plugin, along with their solutions.

### Missing AEM Guides panel {#id192BH200ZAX}

**Issue** - If you do not see the AEM Guides panel in Oxygen XML Author, try the following solutions:

Solution 1:

1.  In Oxygen XML Author, enable the plugin.

    Click **Options** \> **Preferences** \> **Plugins** and select **Oxygen Plugin for Adobe Experience Manager Guides.**

1.  Relaunch Oxygen XML Author.


Solution 2:

1.  If you still do not see the AEM Guides panel, enable AEM Guides window.

    In Oxygen XML Author, Click **Window** \> **Show View** \> **AEM Guides**.

Solution 3:

1.  Uninstall and reinstall the Oxygen Plugin for Adobe Experience Manager Guides.

    -   On Windows, uninstall the plugin from **Add or remove Programs** list. Then, reinstall the plugin.

    -   On Mac, access the aem-connector-x.x folder in the plugins folder of Oxygen XML Author, and move it to **Trash**. Then, empty the **Trash** folder.


### Configure port for DITA-OT transformation 

**Issue** - When you run any DITA-OT transformation on files that are processed by the Plugin, the transformation fails with the following error:

![DITA-OT transformation failure error](images/proxy-server-path-error-new.png){width="800" align="left"}

**Solution** - This issue has been fixed by adding a proxy server in-between DITA-OT and the Plugin. This proxy server processes and shares all files requested by DITA-OT for transformations. The default port on which this server has been configured is: `5972`. If you are using this port for some other server, then you can specify a different port for the proxy server.

Perform the following steps to change the default port of the proxy server:

1.  Browse to your \(user's\) home directory.
1.  Create a file named aem\_connector\_proxy.
1.  Open the file in any text editor and add an available port number in the first line of the file.
1.  Save and close the file.
1.  Restart Oxygen XML Author and run the DITA-OT transformation.


### AEM Guides panel does not browse to the opened file location 

Issue: When you choose to open a file for editing in Oxygen XML Author from AEM server, the file is opened for editing in Oxygen XML Author. However, AEM Guides panel does not show the location of the file in the navigation tree.

Solution: This issue has been observed in scenarios wherein the file path contains /content/dam twice in it. By default, all assets in AEM are stored under the /content/dam folder. If you upload or create a folder structure that also contains /content/dam in it, then this issue is observed. You can perform all normal operations on such files, however their location within the navigation tree is not shown by default. To access such file in the navigation tree, you have to manually browse to the file's location. Note that in the navigation tree the duplicate /content/dam path is replaced with /content/assets.

### Configure logging 

Issue: By default, the Oxygen Plugin for AEM Guides does not generate any logs, which makes it difficult to debug any error scenario.

Solution: Perform the following steps to  set up the loggers for oXygen and JxBrowser:

1. Close Oxygen XML Author

1. Create a file named `logback.xml` with the following content:

    ```xml
    <configuration>
        <appender name="R2" class="ch.qos.logback.core.rolling.RollingFileAppender">
            <file>${user.home}/Desktop/oxygenLog/oxygen.log</file>
            <rollingPolicy class="ch.qos.logback.core.rolling.FixedWindowRollingPolicy">
                <fileNamePattern>${user.home}/Desktop/oxygenLog/oxygen%i.log.gz</fileNamePattern>
                <minIndex>1</minIndex>
                <maxIndex>20</maxIndex>
            </rollingPolicy>
            <triggeringPolicy class="ch.qos.logback.core.rolling.SizeBasedTriggeringPolicy">
                <maxFileSize>100MB</maxFileSize>
            </triggeringPolicy>
            <encoder>
                <pattern>%r %marker %p [ %t ] %c - %m%n</pattern>
            </encoder>
        </appender> 
        
        <root level="debug">
            <appender-ref ref="R2" />
        </root>
    </configuration>   

    ```

1. Save the file in the `Oxygen Author 25` directory. (For example, the path would be: `C:\Program Files\Oxygen XML Author 25\logback.xml`)

1. Close the file. This will enable oXygen logs, which will be available at path: `${user.home}/Desktop/oxygenLog/oxygen.log`
1. Open the `oxygenAuthor.bat` file in a text editor.
1. Setup JxBrowser-related logs by adding the parameter
 `-Denable.aem.jx.log=true`. This enables JxBrowser-related logs, which you can view at path: `${user.home}\AppData\Local\Temp\Oxygen_Plugin_Javax_Log.log`:
    



    ```java
    SET OXYGEN_JAVA=java.exe
    if exist "%JAVA_HOME%\bin\java.exe" set OXYGEN_JAVA="%JAVA_HOME%\bin\java.exe"
    if exist "%~dp0\jre\bin\java.exe" SET OXYGEN_JAVA="%~dp0\jre\bin\java.exe"
    rem Set environment variables
    call "%~dp0\env.bat"
    %OXYGEN_JAVA% -XX:-OmitStackTraceInFastThrow -XX:SoftRefLRUPolicyMSPerMB=10 -Djdk.module.illegalAccess=permit -Djava.ipc.external=true 
    -Denable.aem.jx.log=true -Dsun.java2d.noddraw=true -Dsun.awt.nopixfmt=true -Dsun.java2d.dpiaware=true -Dsun.io.useCanonCaches=true -Dsun.io.useCanonPrefixCache=true 
    -Dsun.awt.keepWorkingSetOnMinimize=true -Dcom.oxygenxml.app.descriptor=ro.sync.exml.AuthorFrameDescriptor
     -Dcom.oxygenxml.ApplicationDataFolder="%APPDATA%" -cp %CP% ro.sync.exml.Oxygen %*
    ```
    

With the previous steps, the logs will be enabled and you can use them to debug the problems.
