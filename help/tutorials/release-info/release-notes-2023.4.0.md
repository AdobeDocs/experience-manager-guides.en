# April 2023 release of Adobe Experience Manager Guides as a Cloud Service 

This release note covers the upgrade instructions, compatibility matrix, and issues fixed in version April 2023 of Adobe Experience Manager Guides (later referred as *AEM Guides as a Cloud Service*).

For more information about the new features and enhancements, see [What's new in April 2023 release of AEM Guides as a Cloud Service](whats-new-2023.4.0.md).

## Upgrade to the April 2023 release

Upgrade your current AEM Guides as a Cloud Service setup by performing the following steps:

1. Check out the Cloud Services' Git code and switch to the branch configured in the Cloud Services pipeline corresponding to the environment that you want to upgrade.
2. Update `<dox.version>` property in `/dox/dox.installer/pom.xml` file of your Cloud Services Git code to 2023.4.249.
3. Commit the changes and run the Cloud Services pipeline to upgrade to the April 2023 release of AEM Guides as a Cloud Service.

## Steps to index the existing content (Only if you are on a version prior to September release of AEM Guides as a Cloud Service)

Perform the following steps for indexing the existing content and using the new find and replace text at map level:

* Run a POST request to the server (with correct authentication) - `http://<server:port>/bin/guides/map-find/indexing`.
(Optional: You can pass specific paths of the maps to index them, by default all maps will be indexed || Example : `https://<Server:port>/bin/guides/map-find/indexing?paths=<map_path_in_repository>`)

* The API will return a jobId. To check the status of the job, you can send a GET request with job id to the same end point - `http://<server:port>/bin/guides/map-find/indexing?jobId={jobId}`
(For example: http://<_localhost:8080_>/bin/guides/map-find/indexing?jobId=2022/9/15/7/27/7dfa1271-981e-4617-b5a4-c18379f11c42_678)

* Once the job is complete, the above GET request will respond with success and mention if any maps failed. The successfully indexed maps can be confirmed from the server logs.
