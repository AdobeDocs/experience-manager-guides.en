## New features and enhancements

AEM Guides as a Cloud Service provides many enhancements and new features in the August release:

### Layout view in the Map Editor

Now you can view the complete layout of a DITA map in the Map Editor. When you open a map for editing, it opens the **Layout** view of the Map Editor. In this view, you can see the map hierarchy in a tree view and also organize or structure the topics in a map.

The Layout view contains a separate tool bar which helps you perform many tasks on the topics present in a map. 
You can insert topic references, topic group, key definitions in a map. You can reorganize the topics present in a map by moving them up, down, left, or right. You can also drag-and-drop the topics to move them in a map. The Map Editor also provides the icons to  lock or unlock files, check the version history, and do a version label management. 


The Layout view also provides the **View Options** to show or hide line number, show or hide check box, or show the file name or title  for the topics in a map.

You can also view the topics based on the conditional filters applied on them.

In addition to organizing topics in the map file, you can also add, move, copy, paste, or delete references using the **Options** menu available for an element in the Layout view. You can also drag-and-drop a topic or a map from the repository panel to the map opened in the Map Editor.

The right panel displays the Content Properties and the Map Properties in the Layout view of the Map Editor. The Inline Attributes defined for the selected topic are displayed against the topic in the Layout view. For example, you can quickly find all topics which have the platform attribute defined as `IOS`.

Now you can also set the metadata information for the topics or the map. You can define the Nav Title, Link Text, Short Description, and Keywords for the selected topic or map.

For more details, see *Layout view* section in Using Adobe Experience Manager Guides as a Cloud Service.

### Inline Attributes in the Editor Settings

AEM Guides now allows the configuration of **Inline Attributes** by your administrator from the **Editor Settings**. You can also add new inline attributes or delete the existing ones from the **Inline Attributes** tab in the Editor Settings. 
The configured Inline Attributes defined for a topic are displayed against the topic in the Layout view.

### Additional Filters in the Repository view

Now the filter search in the repository view has been made more powerful. Two new search criteria, **Last Modified** and **Tags** have been added to filter the files and to narrow down your search in the AEM repository:
* **Last Modified**: You can look for files that have been last modified after a selected date but before a selected date. You also have the option to use the predefined criteria  and look for files that have been last modified in the last 2 hours, last week, last month, or last year.
* **Tags**: You can also look for files that have specific tags applied on them. You can either type the tag or select it from the dropdown list.
