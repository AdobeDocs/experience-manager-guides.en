# PDF template {#PDF-template}

Using a template ensures consistency in content layout and structure. As templates are predefined, you can avoid rework on formatting issues that arise for every new project or updates. Templates enable you to design page layouts, style content, and apply various settings to customize your PDF.

## Factory and custom PDF templates

There are some sample factory templates shipped out of the box, which the developers can use as the base templates to create customized templates per their organizational requirements.



## Create a new PDF template {#create-pdf-template}

You can create custom PDF templates with specific page layouts and define formatting for page layout components (like TOC, index, glossary) or DITA components (like heading, paragraph, list) using stylesheets. 

To create a new PDF template, perform the following steps:
1. In the Web Editor, go to the **Output** tab.
1. Select **Templates** <img src="./assets/template.svg" alt= "templates icon" width="25"> in the left panel.
<img src="assets/create-pdf-template.png" alt="Create PDF template" width="400">
1. In the **Templates** window, select the **+** icon next to **Templates** and choose **PDF Template**.
1. In the **New PDF Template** dialog, select a factory template which you want to use as a base to create the custom template. You can also use the search box to search for a template.
1. Specify a title for the template.  

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >  You can also preview a thumbnail for the template while creating and duplicating a template. Edit or delete the thumbnail using [**Properties**](#properties-option) in the **Options** menu after creating the template.
   
1. Click **Create**. 

   The new template is created and added in the **Templates** panel. 

## Duplicate a PDF template {#duplicate-pdf-template}

If you want to create a new template with the same page layouts and formatting as that of an existing template, you can create a copy. Once a template has been duplicated, you can further customize its components as needed.

To duplicate an existing PDF template, follow the below steps:
1. In the Web Editor, go to the **Output** tab.
1. Select **Templates** <img src="./assets/template.svg" alt= "templates icon" width="25"> in the left panel. This opens the **Templates** window.
1. Hover over the template that you want to duplicate and select the **...** *Options* icon and choose **Duplicate** from the context menu.

   This opens the **Duplicate PDF Template** dialog.   

   <img src="assets/duplicate-template.png" alt="Duplicate PDF template" width="350">  

   *Select a template to duplicate, preview the thumbnail, and update the title in the **Duplicate PDF Template** dialog.* 

1. Specify a title for the template.

   The **Title** field is pre-populated as a copy of the same title as the source template. You'll view an error message if the template with the same title exists.  



1. To specify a preferred title, remove the pre-populated title and specify a title.
1. Click **Duplicate**.
   
   A duplicate template is created and added under the **Templates**.

## Other operations on the templates

You can also perform the following operations on the templates from the **Options** menu:

### Delete

Select the Delete option to delete the selected template. Then, select Yes on the confirmation prompt. 
The preset is removed from the **Templates**.

### Properties{#properties-option}

Select this option to view and edit the properties of the template. You can preview the existing thumbnail for the template. You can also edit or delete the thumbnail. You can also change the title and description of the template.

Once you have created the custom template, you can choose it from the Page Layouts in the PDF output preset.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >  Your adminstrator can download the latest templates from the following path and replace the existing ones:
   >
   > `/libs/fmdita/pdf`

   The various template components that you can customize are categorized under the following sections:
   * Page Layouts: A typical PDF contains different pages, such as a front cover or title page, TOC, chapter, index, citations, and more. The Page Layouts section allows you to design the look-and-feel of different pages that would make up your PDF. For more details, view [Page Layouts](../native-pdf/components-pdf-template.md#page-layouts).

      In addition to the appearance, you can also define the arrangement of page elements such as the header, footer, and content areas on a page. To know more on customizing a page's layout, see [Create and customize page layouts](components-pdf-template.md#create-customize-page-layout).

   * Stylesheets: The settings in the Stylesheets section allows you to customize the look and feel of the page layout components like the TOC, index, glossary, citations, and more. In addition, you can also customize the styles for the DITA content like headings, paragraphs, lists, and more. To know more on using the stylesheets, see [Use Stylesheets to customize PDF](components-pdf-template.md#stylesheet-customization).
   * Resources: Store asset files that you would need to customize or design PDF templates. Assets such as logos, custom fonts, background images, and more are stored in the Resources. 
   You can also use resources present at any other location in the repository. You donâ€™t need to create duplicate resources for each template, and you can keep them in a shared folder and use them in all Native PDF templates.

      To know more on utilizing resources, see [Work with resources](components-pdf-template.md#work-with-resources).
   * Settings: Configure the output settings for generating a PDF using the template. This section allows you to define template mapping for various pages in a PDF, chapter starting page, print markers, citations, and more. 
   You can also arrange the order in which they should appear in your final PDF output.
   For more information on applying settings, see [Advanced PDF Settings](components-pdf-template.md#advanced-pdf-settings).
