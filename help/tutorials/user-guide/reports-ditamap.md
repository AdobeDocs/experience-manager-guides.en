# DITA map report from the map dashboard {#id205BB800EEN}

AEM Guides provides your administrators the reporting capabilities to check the overall integrity of the documentation before it is pushed live or made available to end users. DITA map report from the map dashboard in AEM Guides provides valuable information such as the missing topics, topics with missing elements, UUID of referenced topics and media files,and review status of each topic. A detailed individual topic-level report also provides DITA content-related information such as content references and missing images or cross-references.

    The Reports page is divided into two parts:

    -   **Topic Summary:**

        Lists the overall summary of the selected map file. By looking at the Summary, you can quickly know the total number of topics in the map, missing topics, number of topics that have missing elements, topics' state â€” In Draft, In Review, or Reviewed state.

    -   **Details:**

        When you click on a topic, a detailed report of the selected topic is displayed.

        Items highlighted under **A**, **B**, **C** and **D** are described below:

        - **Topic**: The title of the topic specified in the DITA map. Hovering the mouse pointer over the topic's title displays the complete path of the topic. If there are issues in the topic, like missing references or images, then a red dot is shown before the topic's title.

        - **UUID**: The universally unique identifier \(UUID\) of the file.

        - **Author**: User who worked last on this topic.

        - **Document State**: The current state of the document - Draft, In-Review or Reviewed.
