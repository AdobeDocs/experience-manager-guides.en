# DITA map report from the Web Editor {#id231HF0Z0NXA}

AEM Guides comes with a feature in the Web Editor that enables you to check the overall integrity of your references and generate reports for them.

You can view the topic list, manage the metadata of all references, and view the multimedia list for the current map from the **Reports** tab in the Web Editor.

## Generate a CSV from the Topic List view 

The **Topic List** view provides detailed information about your topics, such as the reference type, document state, and author.

You can create a report of the topics by performing the following steps:

1.  In the **Repository** panel, open the DITA map file in Map View.
1.  Click the **Manage** tab.
1.  Double-click **Topic List** on the left. The list of topics present in the DITA map is displayed.

## Generate a multimedia report 

The **Multimedia**report provides detailed information about the multimedia used in your map, such as the title, type \(audio, video, and images\), files in which multimedia is used, and the reference type of the files, in which they have been used.

## View and fix the broken links{#report-broken-links}

The **Broken Links** is a useful report which provides you with the details of the broken links present in your current map. You can view the broken links, which can be for DITA topics, multimedia file references, content key references, and so on. You also have the ability to fix the them here itself.
The report provides detailed information such as the broken link, link type, files in which reference is used, and the type of files they have been used in. 
You can view the report for broken links by performing the following steps:
1. In the **Repository** panel, open the DITA map file in Map View.
1. Click the **Manage** tab.
1. Double-click **Broken Links** on the left. The list of broken links or references present in the DITA map is displayed.
1. From the **Filters** panel you can order the list by links or by the names of used in references.

    – When you order by **Broken Link**, the paths of the broken links are displayed in the first column and then the names of all references in which they have been used, are displayed in another column on separate rows. If the same broken link is used in multiple files, then they are displayed on one row and are shown as grouped or sub-rows. For example, the following screenshot shows three broken links in the first column and the reference in which they are used, `TestMap.ditamap` is displayed in the third column on three separate rows.
    ![](images/broken-link-report.png){width="800" align="left"}
 
    – If you order by **Used In** column, you will view the transposed view wherein the names of the references in which the broken links have been used are listed in the first column while the broken links are listed in another column on the same row. For example, the following screenshot shows the reference (in which the broken link is used) `TestMap.ditamap` in the first column and the broken links are displayed in the third column on the same row.
    ![](images/broken-link-filter-usedin.png){width="800" align="left"}
1. You can filter your broken links based on the **File Type** and **Link Type**. The list of broken links is displayed based on your selection in the drop-down. For example, you can choose to display only the content references in your DITA map, and a file shows only the content references used in it.

    Depending on the type of references used in your map, File reference, Key reference, Content Reference, Content Key Reference, Image Reference, and Multimedia File Reference are listed in the **Link Type** drop-down, and **DITA Topic** or **DITA Map** are listed in the **File Type** dropdown.
1. You can also use the following filtering options to choose to display the following columns in the list:

    – **Broken Link** (selected by default) The path of the broken link is specified in the DITA map. 

    – **Link Type** (selected by default) The type of the links. The available options are Content Key Reference, Content Reference, DITA Topic, File Reference, Image Reference, Key reference, and Multimedia File Reference.

    – **Used In** (selected by default) The references in which the broken link has been used. You can click the reference to view it in author mode.

    – **File Type** (selected by default) The type of reference – DITA Map or DITA Topic.
    Click **Refresh** to get a fresh list of broken links and view any change in your map file or if any broken link within your DITA map is updated.
1. You can click on the **Fix link** icon (![](images/fix-broken-link.svg)) to fix the broken link. 

    >[!NOTE] 
    >
    > Hover over the broken link path under the Broken Link column to view the Fix link (![](images/fix-broken-link.svg))  icon.

    You can fix a link in both views- when you have ordered by **Broken Links** or by **Used In**.

    >[!NOTE]
    >
    > When you fix a broken link while you have ordered by Broken Links, the link will be fixed in all the files where it is used (which are grouped in a single row).

1. You need to update the required reference details in the **Update Link** dialog. The details required in **Update Link** dialog would depend on the type of reference.     
Once you fix a link, it is not displayed under the list of broken links. Instead, you can view it under the Topic List or Metadata. 

1. Click **Download CSV** to download the current snapshot of the broken links in the DITA map. The CSV contains the selected columns and the broken links filtered in the Broken Links view. You can then open and view this CSV file in any CSV editor.
