## Addition features available on the review screen 

**Document view and topic view** - By default, if multiple topics are shared for review, then a composite document view of topics is shown to the reviewers. In case of a DITA map review, all topics in the map are presented in the form of a single document, resembling a book view. If you want, you can also click on a particular topic and only that topic is then shown on the review screen.

When you view a single topic, then you get an additional option to switch back to the document view. In the following screenshot, a particular topic from a map file is opened for review. The highlighted option â€” **Show Document View** allows user to switch back to the document view of the map file.
