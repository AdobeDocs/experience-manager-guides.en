# Manage publish tasks using the Publish Dashboard {#id205CC08305Z}

When you have a large set of publishing tasks running on your system, it becomes practically impossible to check each DITA map individually to monitor its publishing task. AEM Guides gives the administrators and publishers one unified view of all publishing tasks running in the system. A list of all active publishing tasks is available in the Publish Dashboard.

The Publish Dashboard gives a complete overview of all publishing tasks currently running in the system.

The Publish Dashboard contains the following details:

- **Map Title** - The title of a map file that is being currently published or is in the publish queue.

- **File Name** - The file name of the DITA map.

- **Output Preset** - Name of the output preset that is used to generate the output.

- **Initiated By** - Username of the user who initiated the publishing task.

- **Started On** - Date and time when the publishing task was started.

- **Elapsed Time** - Time since when the publishing task is running in the system.

- **Delete icon** - Cancel or terminate a publishing task.

The left panel in the Publish Dashboard provides the following filtering options:

- **Output Preset** - Select one or more output presets for which you want to see the currently active publishing tasks. In the following screenshot, the publishing tasks are filtered to show only those tasks that use the AEM Site output preset:

- **Initiated By** - Select a username from the list to show the publishing tasks initiated by the selected user.

- **Map** - Select a map file from the list to show the publishing tasks running for the selected map.

1.  Click **Yes** on the Confirm Cancellation message prompt.

    The cancel command is accepted and cancellation is attempted as long as the task remains active. Once the task is successfully terminated, it is removed from the currently active task list. The task's status also gets updated in the DITA map console as Cancelled. In the following screenshot, the *HTML5* task is canceled from the Publish Dashboard and its status is also changed in the DITA map console.
